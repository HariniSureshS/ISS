# Omdena-ISS Task 1 - Data Tabularization

**Task Manager**: Jianna Park

**Goal**: Convert given case notes and welfare assessment reports into an excel sheet, using parameters given in “ISS-AI data points.xlsx” and “ISS Manual” templates (pages 22-24 and 28). All participants can add columns in places they see fit.

**Purpose**: Consolidate multiple files into a single consistent source. Gain insight on data distribution/sparsity.

**Note**: I wanted to see what we can do with the data given in the resources folder while we wait for more information. Acknowledging we haven’t yet decided on what to prioritize in our project, this task may or may not prove to be useful in the end. If you have strong recommendations, please feel free to give feedback or advice on how best to proceed with this task--I’d appreciate your input on naming convention, formatting, etc.
