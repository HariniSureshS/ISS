Omdena Project: Providing caseworker insights and recommendations based on past case outcomes. 

In this project, you will work with 50 technology changemakers to build an AI-planning model, which helps to improve case management of social workers in child protection, migration, and welfare.				

This will be an AI planning model:
Improve the quality of case management and both cost and time efficiency
Dynamically analyze data and better organize intervention in real-time to avoid unnecessary delays in service
Leverage collective organizational knowledge from present and past practice
Unify and standardize expert guidance to field workers worldwide
Design individualized solution to individual problems of children and families as a result of migration across international borders
