Mariel’s health deteriorated rapidly as she began to use drugs and by the time Javier turned 5 years old, he had been removed from his mother’s care permanently and placed in foster care. The USA Child Protection Authority (CPA) noted that Javier had irregular but positive contacts with his father. The CPA reached to ISS USA to enquire about possible solutions for Javier and in turn ISS USA contacted ISS Mexico. ISS Mexico informed the father that his son Javier was actually in foster care and that a thorough assessment was necessary to determine if placing Javier under his father’s care was actually in the Javier’s best interests. ISS USA and ISS Mexico worked closely together to provide a comprehensive assessment and assist the US Court, which then decided to return Javier under his father’s care. ISS Mexico supported Jose and his family throughout the process and assisted them in making an appropriate plan of integration Javier in his “new” family environment across the border. ISS Mexico conducted daily home visits for two weeks, and then once a month during one year. These home visit reports were forwarded to the USA CPA via ISS USA and the case was closed in a year.",

Her biological father is still alive and works in Dwangwa in Nkhotakota district but she cannot live with him because her step mother ill-treats her (biological mother died after her birth). She claims she left her uncle’s home due to ill-treatment. During the afternoon of April 29th, 2013, upon knocking off from school she decided to leave for Dwangwa where her biological father lives but she had no money for transport. At dusk she had arrived at the flea market in Lilongwe, where an unknown man approached her and offered to assist her. He walked with her to a place called Mchesi to look for place to sleep for her. They went to 2 Rice Mills where they were turned down. The 3rd Rice Mills took them in. The unknown man allegedly paid MK500 for the accommodation and went in with the girl where he raped her and gave her MK1000 promising to return the following morning to pick her which he never did. The 2 men at the Mill provided her with Dinner and in return raped her one after the other and gave her MK370. The following morning she boarded a bus en-route to Dwangwa but her fare ended at Salima where she got stranded and started crying. Her cry attracted the attention of well- wishers who then referred her to the Police Station. The Police Victim Support Unit immediately took her to the Hospital for check-up where it was confirmed she had been defiled. HTC was done and proved she was HIV Negative. She got PEP immediately but for Emergency Contraception she had to go to another health centre. Unfortunately, the hospital did not have Emergency Contraceptives and instead referred her to another health centre for support. Ireen was interviewed in order to find out who her father was. He was later identified and contacted. Unfortunately the father did not show any serious concern for his child even after being told the whole nasty story about his young daughter.",

With this information, the uncle decided to send her to this service.

On the move, he spent time in the streets, met another runaway boy and together, they decided to go to Gambia hoping to be safer there, where no one would take them back to the daraa. The two boys’ trip together only lasted a short time, as the other boy stole their money and left Daoud alone. Luckily, a kind man rescued him, took him in, and sheltered him for three years before helping to find his family of origin, finally returning him. During that time, Daoud worked in the fields with the foster family, but completely lost contacts with his family of origin. His story is typical of many talibé (or former talibé) boys who run away from the daraa as victims of violence, and become separated street children once on the move. His decision to move to a neighbouring country was not motivated by specific reasons, other than following another child and thinking he would be safer, fearing he would be returned to the daraa (another common fear for run-away talibé boys), where he expected to suffer even more abuses by the marabout as revenge for having run away. Being with another child on the move proved again quite unsafe, as the other child even stole the little money he had. His story as talibé also features another very typical aspect: complete rupture of contact with the family, to the point that for three years he was unable to provide any useful information on his origin and family, which delayed reunification. His permanence with a voluntary foster family appears to be a very lucky coincidence. This case of family reunification seems successful, as both the boy and his parents appeared happy to be together again. Joint work of the CAP, AEMO and ENDA is therefore a valid example of the importance of linking grass-roots child protection structures with the governmental system and the assistance of civil society organizations.",

In December 2013, during the abrupt conflict which took place, Joseph had to flee to the UNMISS PoC for personal safety while his uncle got killed in the fight. He was later identified by a school officer at the PoC upon which he was registered by Save the Children as UASC. During the registration process he gave accurate information about his home in Walgak which was near the only church building there. This made the tracing work easier and quicker and after the verification of the information given by Joseph and the parents about one another, reunification was arranged and implemented. Accompanied by a case worker from the FTR partner they both boarded a UNHAS flight to Walgak where Joseph was successfully reunified with his parents. Reintegration follow up has been conducted for Joseph as was intended in the case management plan and Joseph was found to have successfully settled in and joined Walgak primary school (with the support of Save the Children) to continue with his education. A case conference was later conducted and it was realized that there was no further protection concern and the case was formally closed.",

Facts: 17 year old boy, Hazara ethnicity, eldest son of 11 children. Family resides in Dashti Barch district, Kabul. His father aged 48 years was a policeman until he lost his job two years ago during the reorganisation of the police force. His father started saving to send his son abroad more than ten years ago. The decision to go abroad to a western country was made by his father. He and his mother participated in the decision and he chose Italy as a destination. He wanted to go because there are no good education or job prospects in Afghanistan. His father paid a smuggler in Kabul US$10,000 to take his son to Italy. The journey: His plan was to go to Italy because he had heard that Italy is accepting Afghan children as refugees. He has no relatives or friends in Italy but he has seen nice pictures. It does not matter if you have no relatives or friends in the country; it is good to live in a multicultural community. He will be educated and get a good job. He travelled from Kabul to Iran with a smuggler. He crossed into Iran at the Nimroz border. When he arrived in Turkey the smuggler put him and 24 other children in a room. The conditions were very bad, it was hot, dirty and there was very little food. The smuggler visited them every day for one month and then one night they were taken by bus to a river. Four small motor boats had been placed in a river and six children were allocated to each boat. The plan was to make the two hour journey by boat to Greece. The Turkish police were waiting for them on the beach. Six children ran and hid in the bushes but he and the other children were caught and put in jail. The Turkish police telephoned his father and told him to transfer US$1,000 through Western Union bank to pay for his air fare back to Kabul; otherwise he would remain in prison. His father paid the money and he was deported back to Kabul one week ago. Outcome for the child: He is living with his family and working as a casual labourer until he gets enough money to try again. He will try and go to Australia next time. He has heard of Afghan children drowning in the river between Indonesia and Australia. The smugglers are getting high dollars and using old boats. He will go to Australia to study, get a good job, send money to his family and then he will come back to Afghanistan. His father said he paid a further US$10,000 to a smuggler to take his younger son to Europe. His younger son was deported from Iran and he will also attempt the journey a second time.",

Mother made decision for education and financial prospects. Surviving child on return lives with family and no plan to make journey again. Facts: Two brothers, 14 year old and 16 year year old, Pashtun ethnicity from Kabul. Elder married sister lives in London and two younger brothers reside with parents in Kabul. The family went to Pakistan during the Taliban period and decided to come back to Afghanistan a year ago because situation in Pakistan was deteriorating. When they got back there was no job for the parents and the schooling was bad. The father suffered from poor health. The mother decided that the two eldest boys would go to the UK. An elder married daughter was already living there and sending money to the family. The mother used this money to pay the smuggler. They did not want to go. The younger boy was very unhappy about going. The mother said 'You are young, you are strong, look [at] your father, he is sick and has no job, and we have no house. Look at other boys who are in Europe, they have jobs and send money to their families for a house and car. You will live with your sister and after two or three years you can invite us and we will all have a good life together.' An aunt in Pakistan had sent her three sons to the west and they were accepted by Belgium. The mother of these boys thought that her sons could achieve the same, she arranged for her sons to go; she did not consult her husband. The relationship between the parents had deteriorated because of finances – the father was an educated man, he had a good job with the last government but now he had no job. The mother took the two boys back to Peshawar on the pretext that they would study there. The father did not know about the plan until he heard that his younger son had been killed. The daughter in the UK did not know that her brothers were coming. The mother did not consult any family member because they might have told her not to send the children. The journey: The travel arrangements were made through a broker in Peshawar. There are many layers of negotiation – you speak to someone who has sent their child abroad and they put you in contact with someone who knows someone who knows a broker who deals with smugglers. She paid an agreed amount of money to a broker to take the children from Peshawar to Iran by bus, when they reached Iran they were to be taken to the Turkish border near a place called Black River. The two boys travelled with a group of ten adults and other children. They had no travel documents. The group was stopped while trying to cross the border at Zaranj by a group of Baluch village people. The governor of Nimroz had announced that day, 'if you catch drug smugglers trying to cross the border just kill them.' The Baluch people suspected that the group was carrying drugs. The younger brother was fatally shot along with others in the group. His body was put in the hospital morgue in Zaranj. The older brother was released and travelled to Iran. He telephoned his mother and told her that his younger brother had been killed. The Iranian police deported him from Iran by bus to Herat. Outcome for the children: Younger brother died on journey. Surviving child is living with his parents and working in Kabul. His mother came to the border with a passport and Iranian visa. She was escorted by her brother-in-law. When she arrived in Zaranj she found her younger son's body in the hospital morgue. She had the documentation done in Iran to enable her to bring the body back to Afghanistan. The boy's body was buried in Kabul. The mother says, 'I am sorry; I am the one who sent my son; and now he is dead.'",

Child is now adult citizen and lives in Norway. Facts: Hazara family in Kabul has a brother who went to Norway three years ago when he was 16 years old. Older brother operates a small IT shop in Kabul. The family lives in a rented house that they share with another family. The younger brother went to Pakistan during the Taliban time. He saw that people in Pakistan lived in a more civilised society. He decided to go to Iran and saw that life there was better than Pakistan. This was the first stimulus. He spent one year in Iran and then another year in Dubai. Dubai was better than Pakistan and Iran but he was in contact with other boys who told him about Norway. He decided that there was no secure future in Afghanistan, it was a backward country and decided to go further away and go to Norway. He asked his father's permission and his father considered the need for him to earn money for the family. He did not get any information about Norway. The journey: He travelled back to Afghanistan because it is not easy to depart from Dubai without a passport. His route from Afghanistan was through Iran, Turkey, Greece, Italy and France He and his family knew that he may lose his life on the journey. Once he started the journey he had to keep going. His family paid the smuggler a big amount of money, approximately US$8,000. The risk was worth it. There were a few guards and police at some borders. In some places there was no smuggler to help him. He had to hide under trucks and buses. There were many risks; he was often hungry, not being able to speak the languages and the fear of being caught when he moved from one destination to another. When he first arrived in Norway he was taken by the police to a camp where asylum seekers are kept. He was held there for six months, he was taught some Norwegian, released and allowed to work. There is nothing that would have stopped him from making the journey.

One day when he was visiting his sick brother in the hospital in Jalalabad, his uncle came to the hospital and took him to his house. His uncle told him that people from the government had destroyed his family house, his mother and younger brothers were forced to leave. People from the government administration had been looking for him. He does not know the reason. The journey: He was given no information about the journey; his uncle said, 'This person is going to take you to another country.' He met the agent in Jalalabad city. He was just wearing his usual clothes, he had no warm clothes, no food, and there were other boys with him, three or four other boys. He did know them before hand, they couldn't talk. It was very dark. It was a very tough time. The agent didn't tell him anything, he was just put in a container. He was scared and it was dark. It took approximately five months. \"We would walk in forest during the night time. We had to follow the agent, we could not talk, we would not see the day light, and during the day we would be in the container, for the toilet we just had a dish. We were given some food once in four or five days. We had a bottle and if we found water during the night we would fill the bottle.” It was starvation; he still has problems with his stomach as a result of this time. \"The agent would not speak to us. If we tried to speak to him he would beat us. We were put in different containers and the boys would change at each destination.\" Only the young people would be in the container, the agent did not travel with them. The journey was all dangerous. \"Because we would not be allowed to sleep during the night time we were very tired and kept falling over. I was always scared and frightened. The whole trip was dangerous, there was nothing in particular. [One of his companions] they just left him in the forest. Most probably he died; he was not able to keep pace with the others. We were supposed to run.\" He does not know which countries he travelled through. His whole journey was in containers or walking at night. He is not sure if he stayed in Calais before he arrived in the UK. The agent left him there and he went to police; the police fingerprinted him and told him he was in London, which was the first time he knew he was in London. He arrived in the cold weather. He had never been outside Nangarhar province before. After police fingerprinted him they took him to the Home Office. A lawyer was arranged, he was taken to social services and then he was handed to a foster family. His foster parents were black English people, he spent just two months there. He was nervous, they could not communicate with him, the food was different, and they would try to speak to him. There were no other children, they had sofas and chairs. During the day he would go the Refugee Council in Brixton for English lessons. He has a key worker who gives him a weekly allowance. He gets GB£50 a week for food and other things. You are put in school, if you arrive in the middle of term you cannot join a course until the next term. He spent two months in the foster home. The key worker visits him to arrange his appointments and see how he is living. The social worker at the council arranges his solicitor appointments. He lives in a two bedroom flat, he does the cooking for himself, he cannot get Afghan bread. Future plan: His plan is to continue to go to school five days a week to learn English. He will get educated and then he would like do something for this country. He cannot go back to Afghanistan, if he can do something it will be for this country. This country is taking care of him. He goes to the mosque. He has no contact with his mother or brothers. He doesn't know how to contact them. He would like to contact them, he told the social worker and she has spoken to the Red Cross, but since then he hasn't heard from them. No-one in his village has a phone. He has no contact in the UK with other people from Afghanistan. He just knows the other Afghan boys in East Croydon. The boy he shares a flat with is another Pahstun from Jalalabad. At the weekend he sees his friends and goes to the bazaar to do shopping. There is nothing that would make him go back to Afghanistan. He is not sure if any changes in the future are going to affect his decision. He would like to visit his family. \"I am not sure if my mother knows I am here.\" He would like to become an engineer or a doctor and work in some business. He has not been given proper status; he has discretionary leave to remain. He has applied for asylum, \"They said I was lying and they refused me. They do not believe my age, they say I am older.\" He cannot remember how old they said he was. He wants to be permanent, he wants citizenship here and to be provided with documents which give him refugee status. He will not go back to Afghanistan. If he went back dressed in western clothing, his family is going to beat him. They would not accept the picture on his black T-shirt, the chain around his neck or his haircut.",

   "case_text": "Atal - Pashtun, Kabul Departed Afghanistan because police and 'family friends' wanted to harm him. Maternal uncle made decision and child agreed. Facts: 17 year old boy, Pashtun ethnicity, eldest of three children. He was born in the Panjshir and went to live in Kabul when he was 10 years old. His father was a supporter of General Massoud during the Taliban time. The father could not get a job with this government. One of his father's friends killed an Afghan soldier. Police came to search his house and arrested him because he had contact with this man. His father was put in jail when he was in school. His maternal uncle said the police were looking for him. He told him not to go home. The boy lived in secret in another house and never went back to his house. The police wanted to question him but he does not know why. The police made a problem for his family, it was political. He had threats from his father's friends -- he does not know why. His father worked in a shop selling gold then he got a small car like a taxi. They lived in a rented house. He spoke with his mother and she said, 'You must leave.' His maternal uncle and his mother made the decision that he would leave Afghanistan. He was happy to leave because he had problems. The journey: He left his country two years ago and went via Greece. His maternal uncle arranged an agent for him, and paid US$2,000 to him. It was supposed to pay for the journey from Kabul to Iran. He went alone with the agent. There were no other boys. He went by bus to Herat and from Herat to Tehran by lorry. He spent two months in Tehran, and another agent took him to Turkey. US$3,000 was paid to this agent. They walked through forest for two days and spent four days waiting in the forest. He travelled in a lorry to Istanbul. During this journey there were 10 other boys. He had no information about how he would travel or the conditions before he started the journey. The route from Iran to Turkey was very dangerous. He travelled from Turkey to Greece in a small ship. \"There were 20 boys; if the motor had stopped we would have all drowned. He had a very tough time in Greece, he spent one month in a park. All the agents are connected. You say take me there, and you arrange for the smuggler to get money from your house in Kabul.” He does not know how his family got the money to pay for his journey. He spent three months in Greece. He was not accepted by Greece as a refugee, and was issued with a letter telling him to leave. The smuggler arranged for him to travel to Italy in a container. He spent up to 10 days in Italy but he does not remember where he travelled there. He travelled by bus to Paris, where he met a few Afghans who were legal but had no jobs or accommodation. Until that point he did not know he could go to the UK. It was his family's decision that he should go from Greece to Italy. He had contact with his mother at that time, but it was his decision to go to the UK. He travelled from Milan to Paris without a ticket. He spent four or five months in Paris, and made many friends while living in square Villemin in the 10th arrondissement. He met an old man who spoke Farsi. This man gave him information in a pamphlet about the UK. What they give you in the UK is very good. He thinks this man was from the French government. He said it is up to you but here is information about every country - Norway, Sweden, Italy, UK and France. He did not apply for asylum status in France. When he read the rules for the UK he decided to go to that country. He got a train in Paris and travelled to Calais via Lille. He travelled without a ticket to Calais. He travelled inside the lorry that went on a ship to Dover. He boarded the lorry in a petrol station. He travelled in the space between the wheels under the lorry. He could have fallen onto the road and died. \"My message to potential asylum seekers is, never come unless you have proper documents.\" He was scared the whole journey. When he got to Dover, he spoke with a taxi man and asked where London was. The taxi man said, \"You have to pay first.\" He was with four guys, one other from Afghan, two from Pakistan. His journey to the UK took him 11 months. Outcome for the child: Since his arrival in the UK, he has worked hard on his studies. He wants to improve his English and next year he will be in the business class. He has Temporary Leave to remain for three months and then he has to apply for an extension. His age is not accepted by the UK social workers: \"They are wrong.” He doesn't have contact with his family. He does not have the phone number of his mother. He cannot remember the number he used when he was in Greece. He does not like mobiles; therefore he does not try to contact his family. Everyone likes his own country but in this country he can make his future. Every day he sees on the news there is bombing, and there are many soldiers in Afghanistan. He would like to be a security officer in the UK.",

Surviving child decided final destination when he arrived in Greece. Facts:17 year old boy, Pashtun ethnicity, eldest son of eleven children. His parents are deceased. His father used to work with Taliban and one day he did not come back. The boy was nine or ten at the time. The death of his father was in the papers. He has two uncles and they support his family. They are farmers and they grow wheat and these things. He had to leave Afghanistan because his grandfather and mother's uncle were killed in the feud. \"A third party killed the killers and they said we did it, but actually we did not do it. It is a long story. So those people were after my family.\" He is the eldest boy and so his uncles sent him and his younger brother away. His younger brother was 16 years old. They wanted to leave. The agent said that the UK was a good place. The journey: He lost his brother on the journey. \"It was a forest and the agents are very bad people. They divided us into two groups, they separated my brother and me. I insisted that they allow my brother and me to be in the same group me but they did not and I have not seen him since.” He started his journey from Pul-i-Alam in a car with his brother, four other boys and an agent. They crossed into Iran, he is not sure of the name of the place but it was a big city. They travelled in buses and trucks and walked in the forest during the night. In Turkey they were kept in a room for 10 days. He got sick there, they were not allowed to go out. There were 10 to 15 boys locked in the room. They did not fight. \"The agent would bring us food and water, and told us not to speak. There was a toilet and somewhere to wash.\" It was in a big city, he does not know the name. He is not familiar with that country. He was put in a container with the same 10 to 15 boys. They travelled a long way. It was like a day and a night inside the container. Then they walked in a forest and there was a river. They were divided into two groups and put in small boat to cross the river. An agent was waiting for them at the other side; it was a four hour journey. Nobody died in the water. \"It was very scary, there were very big waves.\" In Greece they were put into a container and they kept on travelling for many days and nights. They arrived at a place he thinks was Calais. One day they managed to cross to the UK inside a container on a lorry. Outcome for the child: He has had no contact with family. He does not know the phone number; there are no phones in his village. He does not know if his family knows about his brother because he has had no contact. He does not want to return to Afghanistan because he wants to stay here and complete his education. He wants to become a doctor, social worker or a key worker. He has warnings for others who may make the journey. \"It is full of dangers and threats to life. You will be kept in containers, you will have to travel a lot of your feet, and there is no proper food. There will be 30 to 35 boys in the sea in one boat.” His Discretionary Leave to Remain has expired and his asylum case has been refused. He applied for an extension; he is not sure what is going to happen to that application.",

   "case_text": "Mirwais - Pashtun, Kabul Facts: 15 year old boy, Pashtun ethnicity, second eldest son of five children. His father is dead and his older brother has disappeared. His mother and younger brother are living in Kabul with his maternal uncle. He has two older married sisters and one younger brother. One sister lives in Kabul and one lives in Jalalabad. His father died during the Taliban time. He was quite young and cannot remember much about his father. His brother went missing and his uncle feared for his safety. His uncle searched for his brother. The time passed but he did not turn up. His uncle decided that he should leave Afghanistan and go to UK. It was his uncle's decision. His uncle told him, \"We don't know who is our enemy and I cannot protect you all the time.\" So then my mother and uncle told me that we must leave Afghanistan. It was his uncle's decision that he should go and his mother agreed. The journey: The agent said he will be with me all the time. He does not know why the UK was selected, his uncle said he should go to the UK, and they sold their land and paid 900,000Afs (US$18,000) to the agent. The agreement with the agent was that he would get good food like chicken and the agent would always travel with him. The agent said to his mother and uncle that the journey would take a maximum of 10 days and it would be proper and nice. It was altogether a different story. He started his journey from Kabul on a bus and he travelled to Kandahar. So this meant that what the agent said was true - he would go on a bus. But in Kandahar the problems started. They were put in a van with more than 20 boys. Some boys were smoking hashish, and it was hot and very crowded. It was a very bad journey. They arrived in Spin Baldok after three hours. 50 boys were made to stay in a room. They had to sit with their legs crossed - if they stretched their legs they would hit another boy. They were only given boiled pulses and bad bread to eat. There were Hazaras in the room, the Hazaras wanted to go to Iran and the Pashtuns wanted to go to UK. They were asked to sit in a car with six boys in the back seat, three in the front and three in the boot. From Spin Baldak they travelled to Quetta and stayed at the Afghani Hotel. From Quetta they travelled on a big bus and arrived in Taftan on the Iran border at 3am. When they were getting off the bus this man would ask who was sent by Majid. Majid disappeared in Kanadahar. In Kandahar he said, \"I am just going to get some food.\" Then we called him from Spin Boldak and his phone was turned off. The first agent who did the agreement with the family was dressed like a respectable mullah. His family trusted this person. When he saw this agent for the first time he brought a box of grapes to the car so he thought this agent was very good. The agent changed at every destination. None of the agents are good people. \"In Iran we were in a car, I needed to go to the toilet, he hit me and broke some of my teeth and I became unconscious.\" More than 15 boys were put into a small jeep. They could not fit, but the agents made them all stand up. It was very suffocating and some boys fainted. They were taken to a deserted building and put in a room. There were spiders and scorpions. They killed a few but there were many. If he recollects those memories then he thinks he was crazy to have made the journey. They wanted to go the market to buy some food. They had money but as they got off the jeep there were 23 men with Kalashnikovs and they locked us in a room. When they asked for food they said there is no food in this place. Then we meet a very nice person who came into room, we asked him for food, he said he cannot bring food because there is none but he said he can boil potatoes. He gave three potatoes for equivalent of GB£100. He was not sure if this man was with the agents but he could not get into room without getting past the men guarding us with Kalashnikovs. The next morning the agent came and said they would be leaving that evening. The boys asked for food, he said there is none and became aggressive. One of the older boys became angry and said we will leave if you do not supply us with food. The agent said he had a pistol and if you create any problem I am going to kill you. The boy said it is better to die. The agent came back with three more men with Kalashnikovs. That boy was beaten in front of them to make an example. He lost consciousness and both his legs and arms were broken. The boy said, \"I don't mind what you charge me but send me back to Afghanistan.\" A nice agent charged him a price and arranged for him to return to Afghanistan. He had some money with him and the agreement was that he would pay half the agreed price in advance and second inside the Afghan border. They started the journey again and arrived at the Turkish border. There was a very big wall on the border. There was a hole in the wall and they were asked to go through the hole. There were police on both sides of the wall but they did not stop them. He does not know the name of the place. On some boats there were drivers. There was a Muslim driver on his boat. On the other side of the sea there was a forest and we handed ourselves to the Greek police. The police provided us with very good food; they kept us in a camp for 12 days. The children were kept in a separate section, we were given toiletries. After 12 days we were given a ticket for Athens. We went on a ship like the Titanic and an agent came down to the port and asked for our name. If your name was on his list then he took you. I was taken by an agent with six other boys and stayed in his house for one week. We were put inside big boxes that were on a lorry, and the lorry boarded a ship. The agent was not with them in the boxes. The ship stopped in Italy and they were met by another agent, he gave them a train ticket to travel to Paris. They were caught by the police and sent back to the Italian border. He boarded a bus and hid in the toilet until the bus crossed into France. When they arrived in Paris it was night and they had no idea where to go. \"At 3am we were forced to leave the bus station. We were caught by the police. They asked if we had passports. We said no, we are from Afghanistan, please help us - the police drove away.\" They stayed in Paris for three weeks. They made their way to Calais by train from Paris. It was dangerous trying to cross to the UK. \"I was lucky, I got into a container and went to the UK on my first try, and some take four or six months.\" Outcome for the child: He asked the British police for asylum. He was given Temporary Leave, now he has applied for an extension. Three months have passed. He is not sure of the outcome. \"Life in Afghanistan is not good. There is a two-fold danger if you get to leave. The first danger is on the way, the second is when you are here. You have no visa and live in a constant sense of insecurity - this surrounds your status in this country. They tell us to look forward. If you take my case, I have adapted myself to their culture, there are a lot of facilities, I could not dress this way and my hair could not be like this. Either way they would kill us - for being western or force us to be a suicide bomber.\"",

   "case_text": "Yaqoub - Facts: 15 year old boy, Hazara ethnicity, eldest son of four children. His family comes from Ghazni, Qarabagh district. He was living in Iran for 10 years and in 2007 his family was forced to return to Afghanistan. His mother, one younger brother and two sisters live in Iran. He has not seen his father since he moved from Afghanistan 10 years ago. When they returned to Afghanistan the Taliban said his family were not Afghani and robbed them and took all their money. They didn't want to move back to Afghanistan but the Iranian government forced them to return. He does not know if his father is still alive. He thinks the Taliban killed him. For the first two years they sent him money and clothes from Iran, and after two years the connection disappeared. The plan was that the smuggler would take his mother and children to Iran and his father would follow but that never happened. His family is now living back in Iran because when returned to Afghanistan they were treated as foreigners and robbed by Taliban. A man came to their house and asked for money. He hit the man on the head and that night escaped back to Iran. His family followed him back to Iran. His mother decided that he should go to a country in Europe. He agreed with the decision and started the journey from Iran six months ago. He wanted to go to Australia because he heard that it is easy to find jobs and so on. His family decided he should go to Norway; he could get a get good job and maybe get money to buy some land in Afghanistan. They paid an agent US$5,000. They sold their land in Afghanistan and his mother had some jewellery to pay for his journey. His family in Iran relies on his mother working as a servant in other people's homes. The journey: He started his journey in Jada Sora where his family live in Iran. He got the phone number of an agent from a neighbour. He made the connection and was told to come to a place where he was picked up in a car and driven close to the Turkish border. When they got close to the border, the driver told him to cross on foot and he was picked up the other side in Turkey. Two people were shot by border guards while he was crossing. They were wounded; he doesn't know what happened to them. He was put into a bus. There were 40 persons in the bus, it tipped over and 30 passengers died. He is one of only 10 survivors. The bus was full of people from Afghanistan and included adults. It was dark and he is not sure what happened, maybe the driver fell asleep. It was total chaos - he and few other boys walked to a nearby town. When they reached the town they phoned the smugglers and told them what happened. The day after, they were picked up by the smugglers. The smugglers had false Iranian passports for each boy. They drove for a while, and after two to three hours they were told to leave the vehicle. They had to walk for 24 hours, and then they were picked up by another vehicle and transported in a van for almost one week. There were five boys; they did not know each other beforehand. He was very afraid and he was thinking that the police would come and send them back to Iran. The smugglers gave them food. They were not allowed to go out of the van. After travelling for one week they arrived in a city in Turkey. He does not know the name of the place. The smugglers were not good with them at all. They always promised good conditions, they would say just walk for a few minutes but they walked for long hours. The boys were promised good living conditions but never got them. The smugglers bought bus tickets for themselves and the boys. They drove for 24 hours and got off the bus in Istanbul. From the train station in Istanbul they took a bus to another town. When they got to this town the boys were put in a basement for two weeks and then were picked up and taken to Greece. There were 21 boys in the basement and there was one light. They used something as a toilet but it wasn't a toilet. There were no blankets and they slept on the floor. The smugglers bought them some food. They were frightened but did not show their fear because they were in the hands of the smugglers. All the boys were Hazara. When they started travelling from Greece they were given Spanish ID cards, and told, if the police stop you say that you are hitch hiking. The smugglers said we will take less money if you do it this way. He paid US$1,000 in the beginning when he was smuggled to Turkey. People chose different destinations - he paid US$4,000 when he got to Greece. The smuggler said, depending on how much you pay, will depend how we take you. \"The smuggler knows how to get the money - they establish connections, they make you pre-arrange for some person they know will come up with the money. Then you or the smuggler just makes a phone call to the contact person and the smuggler will get the money.\" He called the agent that he met in the beginning and his mother arranged for the money to go to the smugglers. During his journey he did not always know which country he was in because he was always on a bus or walking and was just told to show the Spanish ID card. Each time he was stopped by police he was allowed to continue. He was driven to Norway in a car with three older Iranians. He does not know their status, you cannot ask. The last drive lasted for 12 hours and he remembers that shortly after they reached Norway, he was told to get out of the car and walk. Outcome for the child: He has been in Norway for 13 days. He travelled with boys and families from different countries. Since he has been in Norway he has experienced some difficulties. His age has been tested and he attends courses where they try and teach Norwegian and English. They are just standing there trying to teach without him understanding any of it. He is very confused about whether he will be 23 allowed to stay. He has heard about this Dublin thing and if they find your fingerprints they can send you to another country. It has been one month since he has had contact with his mother. He does not have a phone and his mother does not have a phone in her house. He hasn't got results yet, he had a test on his teeth and hand bones and he is a little afraid of this. In Afghanistan they don't write down your age. He is afraid that there might be a difference between what he has told them and the test results. He just told them what age his mother had given him. He would say to boys who are thinking of making the journey: \"I would tell them if you really don't have to move, if your life is not in danger - don't do it - it is not worth it. Because if it would be up to me - I would say there is not so much big difference between where you live and these countries - people here also have problems. It's not because they only hear good things about the country, but they see that people here have money and can buy things.” His future plan is to study and get a job to earn money for his family.",

He left Afghanistan about one year ago because he feared the Taliban. His brother was working for a commander. The Taliban took his brother prisoner and beat him up very badly. They hit him with a Kalashnikov. After the Taliban beat him up they said go and tell your brother to come to us. Of course he would not go to the Taliban and give himself up so he decided that he would escape to Iran. He does not know why the Taliban wanted him. The whole family advised him to leave. His mother is dead. He was 11 months in Iran; he was working for a gardener in Rabat, Tehran province. He did not stay in Iran because one day he told his story to the gardener who said, 'Don't worry, I will help you.' He told the man his whole life story - he was a kind man who decided to help him. He decided to leave Iran because the situation in Iran is not good. This man wished for him a better future and that was why he advised him to go to another country. \"He said, 'You will still owe me money. When you arrive you will get a good job and you can pay me back later.'\" He is not sure how much the gardener paid to the smuggler but he thinks it was US$11,000. About US$3,000 was his wages. He had contact with the smugglers and they smuggled him to Turkey. He did not choose Norway when he started the journey - the smugglers did not tell him which country they would take him to. They only told him that they would take him to Europe. He did not know anything about Norway. The journey: The smuggler picked him up in a car. He stayed in the smuggler's house in Tabriz and was taken from there to Turkey. He does not know where in Turkey. There were 23 persons in the group - three families with children and the rest were boys like him. All were Afghan Hazaras who had been living in Iran. They travelled in a big van. When you are first in the hands of smugglers it is dangerous. \"It was a scary situation because we did not know when we would get stopped by police. Food was scarce, just enough to keep us going. We had heard that the Turkish police will beat you really bad.\" During his trip one person died. It was when they arrived in Turkey. Crossing a river, there was a hole in the bottom of the boat and it took in water. \"There were only five safety tyres and there were six persons - so the one who did not get a tyre died.\" They were arrested by the Turkish police. The police put them in jail; four of them were released because they were less than 18 years. One person was kept in the jail because he was over 18 years. When he was released he went to Istanbul - there he met some other boys and that's how he got connected with the smugglers again. After one day he found a smuggler. He was taken to a house and kept there for one month. He tried to cross the sea again and had to return back to Turkey. He had to stay in Istanbul for another month there because smugglers could not arrange transport in another country. The smugglers took watches from kids so they did not even know the time. The smugglers did not treat them well. They were not able to wash their clothes or bodies for one month. When he recommenced his journey from Turkey to Norway he was taken another way. He does not know which countries or route they took. It was fast because the gardener had paid the high price. He did not know he was going to be taken to Norway; he was outside some bus station and given a ticket. He said what is this and he was told, 'This is for your final destination to Oslo.' He has not had any difficulties since arrival and is looking forward to his life here. He has not made contact with the gardener as yet. He will repay the debt. Outcome for the child: He arrived in Norway two weeks ago. If he gets a Norwegian passport he will never return. He has never been to school and has been working since he was nine or 10 years old. He learnt to speak English in Iran. He is going to have his age tested; he looks like a man because he has travelled on a long journey. He would say to others, \"If not really necessary, don't do it. But if you have to leave, the trip is very dangerous, you will be starving and there is a chance you will die.\"",

   "case_text": "Murtaza - Hazara, Ghazni Fled Afghanistan because Taliban were told that he worked for the British. Child made decision. Destination Europe and in Turkey decided Norway. Facts: 17 year old boy, Hazara ethnicity, second eldest of six children. He was living in Ghazni, Jaghuri district for six months before he departed for Europe. He went to Iran in 2004. He doesn't have a father; he does not know what happened to him. His mother and his five brothers and sisters lived with his maternal uncle. His uncle did not allow him to go to school. He did not like his uncle and he wanted to go to school. He learnt to speak English in Iran. He studied in Iran, some boys from his village said, stay here if [you] want to work, but if [you] want to study go to Qom. He worked and went to school in Qom. He was sent back to Afghanistan because he had no documents. The police took him and asked for ID and deported him through Islam Qala. He had some money that he had left with a mullah in Iran. The mullah gave him his money and clothes. He went back to Jaghuri to live with his mother and uncle. He started fighting again with his uncle. His uncle asked him what he had been doing and where was his money. His uncle knew that he had learnt English in Iran so he told the Taliban that he had worked for the English. His friends advised him to go to Europe to save his life. The journey: He travelled back to Iran and contacted a smuggler. The smuggler told him, \"If you want to go by this way, it will cost you this much and if you want to go to Greece in a plastic boat it will cost you less.\" He arranged to sell farm land that was owned by his father. He had to pay the smuggler more than US$10,000 to go to Norway. He made the decision to go to Europe after he arrived in Turkey. In Turkey he talked to other boys and got information about the options. He asked about the best place to study and a safe place. He was told that Greece is a bad place to go. He saw many people crossing the border from Iran into Turkey. One woman could not walk and she died; a smuggler took her body back to the village. He spent three months in a prison, where there were smaller and older children, men and women - it was dangerous and dirty. The police asked him where he was from; he told them he had no father. An Iranian who was a powerful guy decided to escape, so he went with him. Through some of the boys in Turkey he found a gold smuggler named Jabar, who said he would lend him the money for his journey. The smuggler cost a lot of money but he was good. He put him in a truck and hid him inside some stuff. He had food. There were six persons inside the truck. They were Hazaras from Afghanistan. The trip took nine or 10 days. It was dark and he did not know if it was day or night or what countries he travelled through. The smuggler gave him a bottle for a toilet. Outcome for the child: He has been in Norway for one week. He has already learnt some Norwegian. The Norwegian officer asked him if he had ID. He had a copy of his tazkera and they said would you please show us the original. He told them that he did not bring the original. He will ask his friend to send the original. They want to test his age - he says go ahead. His face looks old because he has tolerated a lot of hardships. All the smugglers are dangerous and they are not kind especially to the Kurdish people. He will never go back to Afghanistan. He has a big problem; his uncle has told the Taliban that he is a translator for the English in Iran.",

   "case_text": "Ewaz - Hazara, Ghazni Iranian government forcing Afghans to return. Paternal uncle and child made decision, destination Norway. Facts: 16 year old boy, Hazara ethnicity born in Ghazni province. He lost his family in Kabul when he was six or seven years old. A rocket hit their house and killed his parents. He was born in Ghazni, Jaghuri district and when he was one year old the family came to Kabul. After his parents were killed he was cared for by his paternal uncle who took him to live in Iran. He lived in Iran with his uncle until he came to Norway. The last time he was in Afghanistan was 10 years ago. He can talk about Iran but not his life in Afghanistan. There are lots of Afghan children living in bad conditions in Iran. He was living with his uncle in Khasran; later on he got a job and worked in a factory making clothes. Other boys around him who did not have friends or relatives are deported by Iranian police back to Afghanistan. Sometimes the police would torture them. \"The time we got a rocket attack on our house I not only lost parents but I got head and hand injuries. I have no relatives in Afghanistan.\" He decided to come to Norway because the Iranian government was looking to collect all his countrymen and send them back to Afghanistan. He has been away from his country for a long time, but he hears that the situation is very bad in Afghanistan. His uncle decided to send him to a western country. He saved some of the money from working and the rest of the money came from his uncle. He does not know how much money his uncle paid. He participated in the decision. A friend of his uncle also wanted to send his son to the west, so they decided to send them together. They did not decide initially on a specific country, just a safe country in Europe. Then a friend of his uncle heard that Norway is good - he had heard about some boys who were there and the conditions were good. The journey: When he left Iran he walked a lot, and he suffered a lot of hunger and thirst. From Turkey we had to take a boat to Greece, it took five to six hours. The smuggler drove the boat, it was an inflatable boat, and there were 60 boys. “There were three small boats tied together. Only the middle boat had a motor. It was a very dangerous.\" He heard that another boat was punctured and sank and all the boys drowned. When they came to Greece they travelled by trailer inside the container - it was hot and difficult - \"we saw on our eyes that we were close to dying.\" He wanted to get out of the container but the smuggler came and beat him to keep him quiet. There was no air, they could not breathe, and he thought he was going to die. The smuggler forced him to sit and be quiet. The other boys were screaming and crying. There was no oxygen and his hands and legs wrinkled and he could not breathe. He was in the container for 48 hours. There were no safety visits by the smuggler. When they came to Greece they were captured by the police and put in jail. They could not see the sun, one time there was a hunger strike of four days. The prison was just for children going to a western country. Most of the children in the jail were from Afghanistan and some were from Somalia. Ten boys tried to escape and two of them were shot and killed by the guards. After the four day hunger strike they were released. One of the boys had an epileptic fit, he did not receive medication, and he fell down. When he was released he was given a ticket and he travelled to Athens. He can't remember the rest -- it was very hard. After Greece we talked to the smuggler, it was not interesting for us to know which country we travelled through. Our only interest was to reach Norway. After Greece he came to Norway in a container, there were 18 boys; there was no light, no toilet. For 48 hours he did not eat anything. We were not allowed to take any luggage. Those who had a mobile, the smuggler took it from them because if someone called they could be discovered. They travelled in western clothes; they had to wear these clothes for the journey. He wore western clothes in Iran. When he left Iran he had money and a small bag. When he came to Greece the situation was different. He could only carry some money but no bags. When he ran out of money, he got money through a transaction with people not a bank. He was put in a container that was lifted onto a boat, he travelled almost 36 hours. He was taken out of the container, handed over to another smuggler and continued the journey. After they were taken out of the container, the smugglers were waiting for them, they arranged a small car and they travelled to Sweden. From Sweden they travelled to Norway. It was a kind of mini bus, and there were 13 boys. It took two or three days, with two drivers. The boys were all Afghans, the drivers were Kurds. Outcome for the child: He has been in Norway two or three weeks. They are going to test his age. He does not know his uncle's phone number so he cannot contact his family. Another boy contacted his uncle on the journey, that boy is now in Sweden. He did not stay in Sweden because his uncle told him to go to Norway. His plan is to get a good education, and then he will work here. He has no plan to return to Afghanistan, he has no relatives there. He cannot return.",

   "case_text": "Mohammad Ali - Hazara, Wardak Child is an orphan and must care for younger siblings. Child decided Europe and Norway as final destination when he got to Greece. Facts: 16 year old boy, Hazara ethnicity, eldest of four children. He has 2 younger brothers and one sister. He lost both his parents, his mother died during delivery of a baby. His father died during a conflict between Taliban and people in his village. The Taliban wanted to take their land. That was eight years ago. His mother died 10 years ago. When he was in Afghanistan his family had some farm land. His family also had conflict with some people about their land but they kept some and farmed it. Four years ago they went to Pakistan and then moved back to Kabul two and a half years ago. The conditions in Kabul were very bad; he worked for a man in Kabul fixing trucks. The situation in Wardak was not good. It was ruled by Taliban so he decided to go somewhere else to secure their future. He talked to his brothers and sister and told them that he would have to go somewhere else to get a future for them. He used the money he got from selling his father's land; it was almost US$4,000. He had inherited the farm land from his father. His brothers and sister stayed with his auntie, she is a widow and lives with his uncle. His two younger brothers can weave the carpets and they can work as carpet makers. He and his brother learned how to weave carpets in Wardak so when he went to Pakistan he got work making carpet. He did not have any opportunity to go to school. His brothers are interested in going to school but do not have the opportunity. They have a plan to go to school in the future; the situation at present does not allow them to go to school. They have to work so they have enough money to buy food and to live. In Kabul they had no place to live. In Wardak, the Taliban rule. He talked to his siblings and aunt and told them that he would have to go to another country to make their future. He talked to other people; his uncle's friends helped to put him in contact with a smuggler and lent him some money. He went to Iran, then to Turkey. The journey: On the way they walked and travelled under great difficulty. He took a boat to Greece; it took seven or eight hours. After he came to Greece he was caught by police. His health was not good, and the police sent him to the hospital. He escaped from the hospital. They caught him and he was put in the prison. He was released after one month. He went to Athens, then to Patra. The smuggler told him and 15 other boys to get inside a container, which was put on a boat and he was taken to Italy. After the boat arrived he had to escape from the container. He does not know where in Italy. They tried to find a train station to continue their journey -- they did not have a smuggler with them. There were those who had money and they got help from a smuggler. He did not have money. \"It is life and death to get into the container.\" He had to suffer these problems but it was even worse in Afghanistan. Their situation was bad on the journey but it only lasted for some months. In Afghanistan it lasts forever. The journey from Afghanistan to Norway took five to six months. He took a train from Rome to Paris, he travelled with other boys. Until France they did not have any documents, they had to hide under the seats. Then they got a train from Paris to Denmark without paying. They did not have tickets; there are seats at the end of the train that you can hide under. Some of the boys were caught by police. In France there are lots of boys waiting to get on trains to other countries in Europe. At the station there is no problem getting on and off trains. The problem is getting caught while you are on the train. We had to ask other Afghan boys to help us with information - how to get to the train station, how to read the signs. Some of the boys can speak English, he can read the Latin letters a little bit. He made his plan to travel to Norway when he got to Greece. When he arrived in Greece he saw that it was not a good country to live. There are lots of problems, there is no place to live, it is hard to seek asylum, and the food is very bad. He saw boys from his country surviving in very bad conditions; they did not receive help from the government. They lived on the streets. When he arrived in Italy he met some Afghan boys. They had received some ID from the government but they sleep on the park and had food from the church. He does not know which countries he travelled through to reach Denmark. He was taken inside a lorry. From Denmark to Sweden he travelled by train. The guards on the train asked for documents. \"We tried to communicate, they were a little kind and they let us come to Malmo, Sweden.\" When they arrived in Malmo, they talked around: some said Sweden is better, some said Norway, some said Norway is taking a lot of boys and families, so that is why he decided to come to Norway. Outcome for the child: He has no plan to return to Afghanistan. He does not have a place to live. \"It is not safe, the war is all over. There is no good economy so if I go back it will be even worse than before.” His plan is to go to school and later on he has to help his family economically. \"The important thing is that I live safely, with no danger of war and then I can help my family.\" If he can, he will bring his brothers and sister to live with him in Norway. He has not had contact with family; he has been here two weeks. He wishes to make contact with them, at least they should know he has reached his destination. \"Since I was born I have not had any safe place or good moments so I hope this government will accept me.\"",

Facts: 16 year old boy, Hazara ethnicity, oldest son of four children. He is from Malistan district, Ghazni. His parents, three sisters and two brothers remain in Afghanistan. He has one older sister and the rest are younger. He and his father worked as daily labourers. When he was ten years old his family moved from Ghazni in Herat. He has two main problems: one with his own family and one was an economic problem. He does not want to disclose the family problem. The economic problem was that his family did not have enough money to survive. \"If you don't have money it is difficult to survive.\" He went to Iran and worked for four or five months. The boys he worked with in Iran decided to go to a western country. He decided to make the journey with these boys. Some boys talked about Sweden and some boys talked about Norway. He decided to go to Norway. When he started travelling, lots of boys talked about Norway and that is what made him decide. They said it is easy to get asylum and to find a job and the standard of life is good. The journey: There were some smugglers and these boys found their phone numbers and contacted them. The smugglers were engaged to help them go to Turkey. They paid about 700 euro for the smuggler to take them from Tehran to Istanbul. When they got near the border they had to walk for eight hours and then they came inside the Turkish border. Before they got into the boat the smuggler said there would be 15 people. When the boat started the journey there were 30 people. They heard a story about a boat carrying 27 persons and they all drowned. There were families and kids on the boat, all from Iran. They had travelled for 40 minutes, and then the motor stopped. \"Lots of water came into the boat, all the boys started screaming. We tried to bail the water out with our hands; we saw death in our eyes.” When they arrived in Greece the smugglers demanded money, and they were kept like prisoners until each boy arranged for the money to be paid. Those who did not pay had their feet tied together and were beaten with a stick. Each boy had to pay the smugglers US$2,100. They stayed in Greece for one week. If you have money you can cross into Italy easily, if not there are lots of problems. \"If you do not have much money they put you in the container. One time they heard that one of these truck containers was transporting meat, the boys were told they there would be ventilation to get fresh weather. There was no ventilation, 10 boys lost their lives.” \"In Athens they will put you inside a container on a boat and take you to Italy.\" They did not go by boat because some people on the boats had been stopped; they travelled by road to Austria inside a container. From Austria they travelled to Venice. They did not eat for 44 hours. \"When you go from the container you are unconscious, then you get better and then you can walk.\" They found the train station two or three hours after they arrived. They took the train from Venice to Rome. They saw that the boys living in Rome had to sleep in the park and get their food from the church. After one week they found a smuggler to send them to France. They arrived in Paris on the train; they hid in the toilets when the guards checked for tickets. They lived in square Villemin, Paris during the day and slept under a bridge at night. From Paris a smuggler sent him to Sweden and after Sweden another smuggler gave him a ticket for Norway. Each boy had a contract with a smuggler. If you arrive at the destination the smuggler gets 7,000 euro in total. He borrowed US$3,500 from his uncle and he had saved some money when he worked in Iran. Of course he has to pay the money back. He has an agreement to pay his uncle back within one year. He does not know how he will pay money back. He did not have information before he left Afghanistan or when he engaged the smugglers in each country. The smugglers do not tell you anything in the beginning - they say it is a two hour walk then it is eight hours. Everything is different when you start travelling. The smugglers don't want to tell you about the dangers before you leave. There are different smugglers in each country but they are the same. Boys who could not walk were left in the forest. When they arrive in the destination country the boys do not discuss the dangers they experienced at all. When you arrive you think about the new country - not what happened on the journey. He thinks that 70 to 80 percent do not know what to expect when they make the decision to start the journey. They just send back news about the new country Outcome for the child: He has been in Norway for three or four days. He might be given an age test - if they doubt his age they will have do it. He has not had contact with his family yet. He called them 12 days ago when he was in Italy. He has no plan about his future. He will first have to work for 20 years to pay back the debt. He will have to fix his internal family problem.",

He is from Shidand province, Herat. He lived with his uncle's family. Both his parents are deceased. His father worked for the Taliban and he was killed by the Americans. His mother died in child birth. During the Taliban regime the Americans came and he lost his father. The mujahedeen wanted him to join and fight against the government. He did not, so he moved to Iran almost 8 months ago. He worked there for two months, and then the owner of that place said no Afghans can work here, so he had to go to another place. He talked to boys who were going to another country. They were Hazara boys from Pakistan. The journey: He took his money from the place where he worked and he started to travel with them. There was an agreement that when they arrived in Turkey they must pay the smuggler. Some boys could not pay and the smugglers cut their hands off. \"We saw it happen to some boys so we escaped before we had to pay them.\" They came to Istanbul and then he travelled on a boat to Greece. They failed on their first try but they got onto a boat on their second try. He and another boy managed to hide between the wheels of a truck that was loaded onto a boat. The boat took them to Italy. The truck was driven off the boat and when it started to drive down the road the other boy could not hold on and he fell onto the street. He was able to hold on and then escaped when the truck stopped. When he arrived in Paris the other boy's cousin told him that when he fell down he died, and his body was sent back to Afghanistan for burial. He lived in the park in Paris for one month, and slept under a bridge. The police used to come and catch the boys. He arranged with a smuggler to get some money from his uncle and he took a train to Belgium, Germany and Holland. He was lucky; he was not stopped and fingerprinted by the police.

   "case_text": "Zalmai - Pashtun, Jalabad Unknown person wanted to kill him. Maternal uncle made decision. Destination Norway. Facts: 16 year old boy, Pashtun ethnicity. He is from Shinwari district Nangahar province. His father and brother were killed in 2008 during the conflict. His mother is living in Jalalabad with his maternal uncle. He lived for many years in Kazakhstan when he was a child and returned in 2006 aged 13 years. His father would travel from Kazakhstan to visit other places. His father had a grocery shop in Almaty, Kazakhstan. He would come back and tell them that no country is safe. His father decided that because Karzai was in power the family would go back to Afghanistan. His father was headmaster of a school when the family returned. He was a not a teacher. His father was killed at the end of 2008 and his mother said that he had to move to Jalalabad city to live with his maternal uncle. He left Afghanistan two months ago. He wanted to stay in Jalalabad but some people wanted to kill him, and his uncle told him that he must go to some place that is safer. His uncle has a shop in Jalalabad and these people came and told him that they wanted to kill him to get revenge. They wanted to kill him because of a dispute between two families. His uncle said it is better that you leave this country. He did not return to Kazakhstan -- no one was connecting with Russia any more. His uncles decided that he would go to Norway. He had no idea about Norway, his uncle decided. He agreed with the decision to make the journey. The journey: His uncle paid the smuggler US$10,000 to send him from Jalalabad to Kabul and from Kabul to Herat. He stayed in Herat for 10 days and then he travelled across the border to Iran. He stayed in Iran for 15 days and travelled to the border of Russia and to Kazakhstan. From Kazakhstan he travelled to Moscow and Hungary. When he arrived in Hungary he found a phone number to contact the smuggler in Budapest. When he arrived in Budapest no bank would change his money so he decided to go to the police and ask for asylum. He then decided to wait and find a money changer. Then he got some food. The smuggler gave him a train ticket to Germany and from there he got a train direct to Sweden. He was told that from Germany you should pass through Denmark to get to Sweden. In Sweden he got a bus ticket for a bus to Norway. His ticket was checked during the journey but he was never asked for his ID or passport at any stage of the journey. His father organised his taskera before he died. He travelled with some other boys. There were many dangers. When they had to walk across the border of Kazakhstan and Russia it was difficult to walk up and down the mountains. They were afraid of guards on the border because they beat people. He had no problem with weather: he had warm clothes and a bag of food. When they travelled through the Ukraine they had to pass through water and in some places there was snow. They were driven in a car and crossed the border by foot. When he was in the car there was the smuggler and some other people. These people did not know about his journey. He was afraid of animals and people could be dangerous. When the smuggler put him in a room for long time he was frightened. Outcome for the child: He did not apply for asylum in the countries that he travelled through because his uncle had an agreement with smugglers that he should go to Norway. He has been in Norway 19 days. He has not had contact with family because he does not have the number. His plan is to get asylum and then he will get an education and work to help his family. Of course, he must repay his uncle the money for the journey.",

Facts: 16 year old boy, Pashtun ethnicity, eldest of three children. He is from Kunduz, Chardarq district. His mother and one younger brother and sister remain in Afghanistan. His father was killed by Taliban four months ago because his father was a member of the Afghan army. The Taliban tried to force him to finish with army and join them. They sent many letters to force him, and then one day someone said something has happened and he saw that his father was killed. His maternal uncle is looking after his mother. He attended school before he started his journey to the west. He has never worked because his family had enough money because his father was working. One day the Taliban came to his house and said he must join them. He refused and told Taliban that he had to study. He went with them for three days and then they forced him to fight. He came back and told his mother the stories and she said you must leave. Two reasons why he left: Taliban killed his father and forced him to join. \"It is true they forced me I did not have any power.\" The decision to leave Afghanistan was made by his uncle and mother but he said to them, send me to a place that is safe. He did not know before he came here how much it cost - then he called his uncle after he arrived and he told him that it costs 1.1 million Afghs (approximately US$20,000). His uncle told him that the Taliban are still looking for him. He had lots of trouble on the way but it was worth it. The journey: He started his journey in Kunduz, and travelled to Kabul, and Kandahar. He crossed the border into Iran at Zaranj. He met a smuggler in Tehran who took him to the Turkish border. He travelled from Turkey by boat to a small island. He does not know the name of the island. The police caught us. They took our finger print, they left us. The smuggler put him in a container that was loaded onto a boat. The boat stopped in many unnamed places, but of course he did not get off. He is not sure how long he stayed in the container; it could have been 10, 15 or 20 days. He did not have a watch. He had a small place to sleep and some water and food. He did not need to go to the toilet. There were two occasions when he could leave the container and go to the toilet. It was dark; he could not see the sun and he was given bad food. When he got out he had pain in his body. There were different smugglers at each stage of the journey. He was with other boys until he came to an island in Greece. The smugglers treated him very badly, and if he complained they beat him. \"We walked a lot, in places where we walked, they beat us.\" Outcome for the child: He is going to be tested for age; he thinks it's a good idea because he should also know his real age. He handed a copy of his taskera to the Norwegian police. Of course he will pay his uncle back; there is no set time for this. His plan is to be safe, continue his education, and go to school. In future he wants to help human beings. If he goes back to Afghanistan the Taliban will force him to join and he will lose his life. He has a message for boys planning to make the journey \"If you have no problem stay in Afghanistan, if you really have problems then plan your journey very well. My message: if you think it will be fun; it is not a good idea. They should know difficulty of the journey, there are many problems. There should be information about the dangers on radio and in the newspaper. He has some friends who go on the internet and they chat and hear music. They should tell Afghan boys in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan who want to make the journey … that there are many dangers and you could die.\"",

Facts: 16 year old boy, Pashtun ethnicity, second eldest of four children. He has two brothers and one married sister. His father was arrested by Americans three months ago. They accused his father of working for the Taliban. His mother lives with his maternal uncle's family. His father's real job was working with the mujahedeen and recently there was shooting between Taliban and Americans, and his father was accused of being involved. Before he joined the mujahedeen his father was a shepherd and looked after sheep. The Taliban wanted him to join them. His uncle is also a shepherd and he helped his uncle. They lived in the same house and worked together. He went to school for one year when he was six years old. He left school because of economic problems. He left Afghanistan because his cousin told him that it was not safe for him to stay. \"Your situation is not good here because you have problems with Taliban and the government so have no chance to have a good life here.\" It was his maternal uncle and his mother who actually asked his cousin to send him somewhere. He agreed because it was not safe for him to stay in Afghanistan. He does not know how much money his cousin paid the smuggler. The journey: He started his journey in Jalalabad and crossed the border in Nimroz. He stayed in Zaranj for two nights and the smuggler bought him to Iran. He is not sure where he stayed in Iran. He crossed the border into Turkey with 150 boys inside a container; it was so tight they could not breathe. They had no water or food; it took two days and had to use a bucket for a toilet. \"It was so terrible, it was completely dark. All the boys were scared and screaming that they did not want to die.\" They were beaten, they were told that they must keep quiet or the police will catch them. Two boys died on the first day and their bodies were with them one more day. These boys were aged between 15 and 18 years. They told the smuggler, \"We are Pashtun and the bodies must be sent back to Afghanistan for burial.\" The smugglers said they would not send the bodies back because they would encounter a problem with the police. In Turkey they had to wait eight days for weather conditions to improve before they took a boat to Greece. In the middle of the trip the boat ran out of fuel. They moved from side to side, they called the smuggler and he sent some fuel out to the boat. There were 37 families and the boys were Afghans from Iran and Afghanistan - they were crying and screaming. The smugglers had agreed they should put them safely on a boat to Italy. Instead they had to hang on tyres to get onto the boat. They had to hide under the trucks on the deck of the boat. They hid under the trailer between the wheels. When the truck drove off the boat they could not get down. The truck started driving on the road, he injured his hand and other boy broke his leg. They had a plan that when the driver started the car they would scream and driver would stop the car. After two hours driving, the driver stopped to look at the tyres, and then saw them. The boys screamed. The driver was so scared that he just left them on the road. There were three boys and they helped the boy with the broken leg. They got to an olive grove where they met a gardener. He helped them to get to the train station. They wrapped their clothes around the boy's leg to stop the bleeding. They took a train to Rome without tickets. The boy with the broken leg had a friend in Italy. This friend came to get this boy. He and another boy went to France. They met another smuggler in Paris and he arranged for them to travel to Norway. From France they went by car through Belgium. They had to take a train through some countries and there was another smuggler to help them. He bought a ticket and he said the last stop you arrive at will be Norway. They were stopped in many places by the police. The smuggler told them not to say they were going to Norway. We were told to just say the name of the next crossing. He cannot remember the names of those places. The smuggler said if they ask you to show your passport, just say that Afghans do not need a passport. Outcome for the child: He has been in Norway for the past two weeks. His family does not have a phone, but he has telephoned a neighbour to say that he has arrived safely. \"They told me, we will send you to check your age.\" He is waiting on the results. If a family has a problem, they prefer to send one of their sons to a safe place. But of course the journey is terrible. He does not think families know the dangers on the way. Even if I told my family about the bad situations on the journey - if I arrive safely then the family thinks everything is okay. Before he started the journey, he heard these things but he did not believe. Until they see it they will not believe. He has to repay the money for the journey; he has an arrangement with his family. They want it back. They say, when you are settled you can send us the money. He plans to go to school, and then go to work.",

   "case_text": "\"I remember now, as if the things that happened were yesterday, like day by day, night by night, me and my three younger brothers,I went from house to house, begging at the neighbors for a slice of bread. I had 5 children with my mother: 4 girls and a boy. The older sister, since the age of 7, was sent to boarding school, far from us, to study. Then I followed. I studied in boarding school for only one year, first grade. I liked it there: they fed me, dressed me, I had a place to sleep, I could learn and I even made friends.\n \n The following year, when I was in the second grade, I was transferred to a regular school, but I didn't attend much. I liked to learn but not to go to school. There the children laughed at me because I was not of their rank. I didn't have nice clothes, or at least clean ones, I didn't have the necessary supplies and my colleagues had to lend me their pens or notebooks.\n \n I soon realized that my transfer to that school was conditioned by the fact that I would stay longer at home, to take care of the little ones instead of my mother. Being the eldest, I had to take care of my brothers, get food for all of us, at least once a day. My mother was almost never with us. She left us alone at home for days, without food and without protection. But the winter was the hardest for us, because in addition to the hunger and loneliness we endured, we were forced to suffer from the cold. But summer was good for us. It was warm outside and warm inside the house. We no longer had to go to our neighbors every day to beg for food. They were fruits and vegetables that we \"\"took\"\" from people's gardens.\n \n But in the summer, I had other problems. Almost every night, I had to look for my brothers, who, after long days of play and adventures, forgot to return home, or simply could not find their way. In the evenings when I couldn't find them after hours of searching, I built all sorts of ugly scenarios in my mind and always anticipated, like a nightmare, the thought that I would never find them again. But I found them, asleep wherever they could, at the neighbors who sheltered them out of pity, and I was glad that bad luck passed us by… once again. Unfortunately, my silence did not last long. One night the inevitable happened. My brothers did not return home, and I was not as tenacious to find them as I had been in the past. I didn't know who to turn to, or who to tell about their disappearance… except maybe just my mother. But my mother was often away from home, and she wasn't with us that night either. I remember finding her, later, at some \"\"family friends\"\". She was in an advanced state of intoxication, and it seemed that everything we told her about us, about the disappearance of the three brothers, did not affect her much.\n \n I don't remember if days or weeks passed before the first news about them.\n One day, my sister, who had returned from boarding school, and my mother were invited to the Education Department, where my sister and I were offered a place to live with the other younger siblings. I accepted at first, because I really wanted to see my brothers again and I didn't want to live with my mother anymore. The older sister stayed with my mother, but in 2 months she also came to stay with us.\n \n I was brought to the \"\"Casa Așchiuță\"\" of the Save the Children Association (today a real Social Services Center for Children and Families of the Association for the Empowerment of Children and Families AVE Children). My brothers were already here, washed, tidy, as if they were bigger and fatter than the last time I saw them.\n \n \"\"Save the Children\"\", which, in time, I will call \"\"home\"\", has been and is my home until now, when I am already 30 years old and my own family. From \"\"home\"\", for the first time I was sent to school like all the other children in the family, wearing beautiful clothes, having my set of supplies and those needed for studies. I went all the way upside down, happy that I would have a place to go back and, especially, that I would not have to worry about the brothers left \"\"at home\"\". Here no one knew that my mother was an alcoholic and no one laughed at me, here no one teased me that my clothes were dirty or smelly, because I was always clean and nicely dressed, here I could learn freely because I didn't have to I'm wasting my time looking for food. \"\"At home\"\" I found out that adults take care of children and children are free to grow up, to play, to learn, without thinking if they will have another dinner or if tomorrow will be a cold one. Here I grew up in a large family, but united and happy. We had teachers who guided and guided us like real parents, listened to us and supported us in the difficult moments, and guided our walk when we took the wrong path.\n \n Later, after finishing high school, I went to university, to learn to help, in turn, children from disadvantaged families. Throughout my university studies and a few years after graduating, I worked at the Save the Children Association, participating, along with my former teachers and educators, in raising and educating children who, like me, came from troubled families, but who want another future for them - a better one.\n \n Today I have reason to thank God, because I consider myself a fulfilled woman. I am 30 years old, I am married and I have been the mother of a boy for 10 years. I work as a social worker at a foster home where over 200 children grow up. Children who, for various reasons, cannot live with their families, but who will want to start their own family tomorrow, and I want to help them learn to do so, as the staff of the Association taught me , which today is called AVE Children.\"",

The child was seeking comfort from the authorities. The stepfather got more anxious and the battering escalated. Neighbors and visitors had called the public health nurse and social service officials several times about their concern for the safety of a four-year-old boy who lived with his mother and stepfather in a small village. The family had moved to the area some months earlier and the nurse and the health center doctor had seen the family twice and pronounced the child healthy. Following the neighbors’ calls the nurse made a house call and noted that in four months the child’s behavior had changed; the child was frightened and did not play in the same way as during the previous visit. The mother denied having any difficulties or worries about her son or the stepfather. Local social services officials had visited the family once prior to the neighbors’ concern for the child’s well being. During a later house call they failed to notice any matters of concern, like bruises on the child, whom they met briefly in the entryway dressed in winter clothing. The parents denied having any problems with their son. The social service officials contacted the public health nurse, who promised to make another house call. During the next visit the four-year-old boy was standing stiffly beside his bed. The nurse took him on her lap and the child sat there for one-and-a-half hours holding his head against the nurse’s shoulder. The nurse viewed this behavior as a call for protection. She called the social services officials and conveyed her concern about the child’s behavior. Three days later, the boy died after the stepfather had battered him. The cause of death was a subdural hemorrhage causing odema and aspiration of vomit. The autopsy showed over 20 bruises and several scars were found on his body. The bruises and scars were caused by separate incidents of battering over days and months. The mother reported to the police that both she and her child had been victims of domestic violence several times during the previous months. The stepfather had beaten the child with a belt, kicked him, pulled his hair, squeezed him, thrown him down and threatened him with a knife. The boy had started wetting his bed, which was a further excuse for physical abuse. The fatal battering occurred after a bedwetting incident and the stepfather beat the child’s head against the floor. The child climbed into his bed and became unconscious. The stepfather did not permit the mother to call for help and the child died during the night. The mental examination was not required but the perpetrator was sentenced 6 years 2 months for severe abuse and manslaughter. The perpetrator claimed in the investigations that he suspected others to think that he cannot take care of the family and that they will encourage the wife to divorce him. The actions taken by the authorities made him even more anxious and increased his outbursts of violence.",

The public health nurse was worried about a 2½-month-old male child who, in addition to colic symptoms, was very sensitive to touching and handling. The baby was sent to the children’s hospital where no injuries or signs of disease were found. Ultrasound and x-ray investigations were performed. Later, at the age of 3½ months, additional examinations including further x-rays were made. Only a slight suspicion of rachitis was mentioned in the hospital records. At the age of 4½ months the child was brought to the hospital and after resuscitation he died five hours later. In the autopsy several injuries were found. A recent fracture of the skull and a subdural hemorrhage and a diffuse contusion of the brain were noted as the causes of death. Furthermore, a pelvic fracture, a hemorrhage in the medullar canal in the lumbar area and several hemorrhages in the scalp were found. Old injuries in different phases of healing included subdural hemorrhages, several rib fractures and a fracture of the right radius. A re-examination of the x-rays taken two months earlier indicated visible fractures of several ribs; they had previously gone unnoticed.\nAfter a lengthy interrogation the child’s father admitted that he had hit and squeezed the baby several times over the course of months. He claimed, however, that the injuries that caused the child’s death were due to an accidental fall. He had obsessional need to batter the baby, when ever left alone with the baby and when he felt helpless. The mother had noticed that the baby’s cry turned more tense, when the father hold him. However she had no suspicion of the battering since the father was very caring and worried about the well-being of the baby.\nIn the mental examination the father was diagnosed as having a personality disorder; dependent personality with psychotic features, lack of empathy, repressed anger and no emotional contact to his childhood experiences. His intelligence was above the average. In the perpetrator’s childhood, his father abused alcohol and was unpredictable. When he was drunk during the weekends, he was very violent towards his wife and threatened to kill her. He also was suicidal and told stories about a father who killed his children.",

   "case_text": "Allegation: Psychiatrist from Elmhurst Hospital called saying the mother overdosed on Zoloft last night and was brought to the hospital at 6:30 A.M. She was accompanied by her 9 year old son, Vincent. She was admitted to the hospital, but refused to give any information to assist in making a plan for Vincent.\nFamily Background\nAndrea is a 27year old Caucasian woman who lives with her 9 year old son, Vincent in\na one bedroom apartment in Queens that is described as spacious and clean. She is\nunemployed and receives $23 daily in food stamps, $68.50 biweekly in cash, and $624\nmonthly for SSI due to Vincent’s autism/chronic asthma. Vincent’s father is 33 year old,\nand is unemployed. He receives SSI due to an accident that occurred when he was 14\nand left him unable to use his arm. John provides Andrea with occasional financial\nsupport and is involved with Vincent, visiting him 3 times a month. Both Andrea and\nJohn report having positive experiences with each other.\nAndrea has been hospitalized at least 3-4 times according to her sister. She has been\ndiagnosed at different times with schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, major depression,\nand epilepsy. She currently takes Zoloft and seizure medication. \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 20\nPrior Investigations\nThere have been five prior reports dating from 2001 to January 2007 against this family.\nIn January 2001 an anonymous source reported Andrea for corporal punishment,\ninadequate guardianship, and drug and alcohol misuse. It was noted that Vincent\ncommunicated by crying, yelling, and making loud noises. After investigation and\nevaluation of the boy by an early intervention program, he was referred to a specialized\nhospital program and the case was closed, unfounded.\nIn November of the same year allegations of inadequate guardianship, lacerations,\nwelts and bruises were made against Vincent’s father John. The allegation was first\nmade by a police officer to whom Andrea complained after her son returned home from\na visit with his father with a black and blue mark under his eye. A social worker at the\nhospital where his mother took him for treatment made the same allegation. The father\nclaimed that the bruise resulted from Vincent falling off a bed and onto a toy. Andrea\nsaid that he had returned from other visits with bruises so she became suspicious. The\ndoctor who saw Vincent at the hospital did not think the bruise could have occurred as a\nresult of an accident, and that it had to be deliberately inflicted. However, after an\nextensive investigation including several home visits, and interviews with the boy, his\nfather, his paternal grandmother, with whom John lives, the doctor, and Andrea, the\nworker concluded that he “did not obtain any evidence to confirm the allegations.”\nThe case was closed, unfounded.\nIn 2002 a social worker at the preschool Vincent was attending made allegations of\ninadequate guardianship and inadequate food, clothing, and shelter against Andrea. It\nwas alleged that Vincent often seemed uncared for, goes to school without extra\ndiapers, in clothes that are often dirty or stained, and misses a day of school a week.\nAlso, Andrea has usually failed to call the school when he was ill. The precipitating\nevent for the report to the State Central Registry was that a teacher had to put another\nchild’s pamper on Vincent because his mother had not sent any extras, and he was\nwearing the same diaper for 36 hours. Andrea claimed that the diaper incident resulted\nfrom miscommunication with a friend who assists her so she can attend school. She\nforgot to ask her friend to change her child, and she does not change his pamper when\nhe returns from school. The worker concluded that Andrea lacked knowledge of the\nchild’s developmental needs and referred her to a preventive service agency for\nservices. The case was indicated.\nThe next report was made in 2006 by Andrea’s ex-boyfriend’s mother, who alleged\nparental drug and alcohol misuse and inadequate food, clothing, and shelter. Andrea\ndenied the allegations, but said she knew who made the report. She had been\nassaulted by her ex-boyfriend, he was arrested, and she obtained a full order of\nprotection against him. The CPS worker spoke with the district attorney, a friend who\ncorroborated the assault against her, and the AHRC where Vincent was receiving\nservices. All supported Andrea’s story so the case was closed, unfounded. \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 21\nThe most recent complaint was filed by a police officer in January 2007. He reported\nthat Andrea had become irrational, displaying extremely abnormal and erratic behavior,\nwalking in circles, running from room to room, and calling 911 while officers were still in\nthe home. He thought Vincent was also displaying abnormal behaviors similar to his\nmother. They were both transported to a major hospital where Andrea remained for\nabout 2 weeks. During that time his maternal aunt, Elizabeth, cared for Vincent. Andrea\nwas released with a diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features and\nprescribed several medications. She was to be seen by a therapist at the hospital so\nthe case was closed, unfounded.\nIn addition to these reports, Andrea lived with her mother when at least 2 reports were\nmade naming her and her siblings as maltreated. The allegations were educational\nneglect, lack of supervision, and inadequate guardianship. These complaints were filed\nwhen Andrea was 14 and 16. In both cases the sources complained Andrea’s mother\nsmoked crack, left the family alone when she went to buy drugs, and let Andrea and her\nsister be out on the street until late. In the later complaint it was also noted that different\nmen were frequently seen going in and out of the house. Although both cases were\nindicated, it is unknown what services were provided.\nCurrent Investigation\nOn 9/15 the source, Dr. H., a psychiatrist, told CPS that Andrea was brought to the\nhospital by EMS at 6:30 am that morning because she overdosed on Zoloft the night\nbefore. Andrea’s son Vincent accompanied her to the hospital. Andrea took the\nmedication in an attempt to kill herself because she was depressed, lonely, and\noverwhelmed, along with having conflict with both internal and external family members.\nDr. H. also reported that Andrea was hospitalized for schizophrenia in January 2007 at\nanother hospital. Andrea was described as being “alert, quiet, guarded and\nuncooperative,” the latter because she failed to give the hospital staff any legitimate\ntelephone numbers of resources for her son while she was being treated at the hospital.\nHe asked that ACS make immediate plans for care of Vincent. The worker talked with\nDr. H. about respite care as an alternative to foster care, but after consultation with a\nhospital administrator, it was decided that ACS should assume responsibility for\nVincent.\nThe worker held a face-to-face interview that day at the hospital with the child, Vincent,\na fourth-grader, who reported that he does well in school. During the interview, Vincent\ntold the CPS that his mother was “nice and taking good care of him.” He denied that his\nmother hit him and said that his mother would talk with him when he would do\nsomething bad. Vincent added that he had been helping his mother to clean the home\nsince she was not feeling well. In reference to the suicide attempt, Vincent said that he\nsaw his mother take medication, but did not know the reason. The interview concluded\nby Vincent telling the CPS that he helped his mother a lot and hoped that she would be\nbetter soon. The worker also attempted to interview Andrea, however, she did not\nappear coherent. \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 22\nDuring the hospital visit, the worker again spoke with Dr. H., the source. He said that\nAndrea was admitted to the Emergency Unit for evaluation. He also told the worker that\nVincent’s maternal aunt, Elizabeth said that Andrea had been hospitalized over five\ntimes for psychiatric problems and that the family is concerned about Vincent’s safety.\nAccording to Dr. H., the aunt did not feel that Vincent would be safe returning home to\nhis mother until there was remarkable improvement in her mental condition.\nOn 9/16, Vincent was observed at the hospital and found to have no bruises or marks;\nhe was removed to the Children’s Center awaiting placement with a relative after the\ncompletion of an expedited home study. He was later placed with a voluntary foster\ncare agency.\nThe CPS worker had a face-to-face interview with Vincent at the Children’s Center on\n9/17, during which Vincent said that he was home with his mother at the time of the\nincident. He said that he saw his mother drinking “black water”, but he later said that it\nwas “black pills.” Vincent said that he was afraid his mother was going to turn into a\nmonster, but he did not elaborate as to what he meant, even after the worker\nquestioned him. After being asked how he is punished at home, Vincent said that his\nmother tells him not to do whatever he did again, and she has also told him that “I’m\ngoing to punch you in the face.” Vincent denied his mother ever followed through. He\ndid admit to being hit by his mother 4 times with a belt on his arms and legs. When\nasked by the CPS whether he has ever seen his mother acting “weird or out of place,”\nVincent denied that his mother heard voices or talked to herself. He did however, say\nthat his mother feels better when he takes care of her when she gets sick, and he\nclarified his mother’s sickness as when she “gets a cold or when she doesn’t feel good.”\nVincent also explained that he makes his mother feel better by listening to her, watching\ntelevision and being quiet. Asked about his father, Vincent said he sees his father on a\nregular basis. He likes to see his father because they go to the movies and the park.\nThe CPS observed an old scratch mark on Vincent’s forehead and an old circular\nquarter-sized mark on his right arm. Vincent explained the mark on his forehead came\nfrom a fall while playing, but he did not have an explanation for the mark on his arm; he\ndenied that it was the result of being hit. Vincent receives speech, counseling, and\noccupational therapy at his public school, where he is in special education.\nOn 09/17 the worker also had a face-to-face meeting with Andrea in the hospital, where\nshe seemed heavily sedated. When the worker asked her about the incident that led to\nher hospitalization, Andrea reported that she took too many Zoloft, but did not know how\nmany. She went on to explain that she took the pills because she was lonely and\ndepressed. She said she called 911 after taking the pills so that EMS could take her\nand Vincent to a “different location.”\nAndrea said that she was seeing a psychiatrist named Dr. B., but she did not know how\nlong or what his telephone number was. She denied hearing voices and past suicide\nattempts. She admitted she was hospitalized in Virginia while visiting a relative in May \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 23\nor June, but she refused to talk about it. Andrea said she takes Zoloft and Dilantin for\nher past diagnoses of depression and seizures, but she has not taken the medications\non a regular basis. When asked how long ago it had been since she took the\nmedication, Andrea responded by repeating herself. She asked to have Vincent placed\nwith her sister, Elizabeth who reside in Brooklyn. She reported that she does not get\nalong well with her mother or sister; and she hadn’t seen them in over a month. She\nalso stated that Vincent’s father is involved because he brings her money.\nAn interview was held with Vincent’s father John S., on 09/17 after the worker received\na phone call from him. Mr. S. said that heard from Andrea that morning advising him\nthat Vincent was placed in foster care. The worker explained that Vincent was at ECS\nbecause his mother overdosed on pills. Mr. S. said he was aware that Andrea had\nmental problems, but did not know how bad. He said that he had never lived with\nAndrea, and she appeared “fine” when he would see her. He said he only became\naware of her mental problems recently, and Vincent never told him about any problems\nhe was having at home or about any of his mother’s unusual behaviors. Mr. S. was not\naware of Andrea’s prior hospitalizations. Mr. S. Said Vincent is his only child, and they\nhave a close relationship. He visits his son three times a month, and he has always\nfound him well groomed. He denied ever seeing marks on Vincent. When asked by the\nworker whether he was willing to care for Vincent, he refused because of his living\nconditions, which he would not further explain. He thought it would be best for Vincent\nto be placed with his aunt, Elizabeth.\nThe worker interviewed this maternal aunt, Elizabeth on 09/17 by telephone. She\ndisclosed that Andrea was diagnosed a few years ago with schizophrenia, bipolar\ndisorder, depression and epilepsy. Andrea was reportedly under the care of a\npsychiatrist at that time, but Elizabeth did not have any contact information. She said\nAndrea attempted suicide and was in the hospital for at least a month in May or June.\nAt that time, Elizabeth said she cared for Vincent. Elizabeth further reported that\nAndrea had three or four more hospitalizations for the same reason, all occurring within\na year. She could not give details of those hospitalizations. Elizabeth described\nAndrea as being unstable because of her mental health problems. She said the last\ntime she saw Andrea was in July ’07, and she had seen her crying and laughing at the\nsame time. She also saw her talking to herself and hearing voices; however, she did\nnot know what Andrea was saying. Elizabeth said that she has witnessed this behavior\nbefore. Vincent was described by Elizabeth as being very protective of his mother,\nsaying nothing negative about her. Although Elizabeth disclosed that she is not close to\nher sister and hardly talks to her, she wants to be a resource for Vincent.\nIn exploring this possibility, the worker found that Elizabeth lives in a two-bedroom\napartment with her husband and two children. She told Elizabeth that a visit would have\nto be made to her home to conduct a home study prior to Vincent’s placement there. At\nthat point, Elizabeth told the worker of prior ACS investigations, all of which were\nunfounded. She explained that these unfair reports were made by a woman in her\nbuilding. \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 24\nThe worker also contacted Vincent’s maternal grandmother, who said that she visits\nAndrea and Vincent on a regular basis. The worker discovered that this grandmother is\nnot a placement resource because she currently lives in a rented single room. The\ngrandmother said she witnessed Andrea “acting weird” only once when she was\nlaughing and crying all at the same time, but she never questioned her about her\nbehavior. She denied that Andrea talked to herself and was hearing voices, or that she\nabused drugs and alcohol. She described Andrea as being very loving towards Vincent\nso she never considered him in danger while in his mother’s care. When asked whether\nVincent ever talked to her about his mother’s behavior, she denied this. She too\ndescribed Vincent as being “very protective” of his mother. She said she never felt\nVincent was in any danger with his mother.\nOn 9/18 the worker contacted Vincent’s school and spoke with his teacher for the past\ntwo years. She said that Vincent had been attending the school for the past three or\nfour years and is in a special education program under District 75. She added that\nVincent does have an IEP on file from about three years ago, which states that Vincent\nis diagnosed with autism. He has not displayed behavioral problems and is in a regular\neducation, but he receives speech therapy, counseling and occupational therapy. She\nalso stated that there was no prior suspicion of abuse or neglect and that he has good\ngrades and attendance.\nOn 09/18 the CPS worker filed an Article X petition against Andrea and a remand was\ngranted. Vincent’s father did not appear in court as he had previously promised. The\ncase was adjourned to 10/11.\nOn 09/20, the CPS called Vincent’s father to ascertain why he had not gone to court\nand to inform him about the next court date. Mr. S. said he had gone to court but he\nwas late. He said he would show on 10/11. He was then asked if he could provide the\nnames of any relatives that could be a resource for Vincent if maternal relatives should\nnot be accepted. He said he did not have any in mind, but he would call back if he\nthought of any.\nOn 09/26, the CPS worker received a phone call from the psychiatrist, Dr. H, at the\nhospital where Andrea had been admitted. He said Andrea was discharged from\ninpatient psychiatric unit on 9/25 and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and\nprescribed Zoloft. Andrea was also diagnosed with a seizure disorder and was\nprescribed medication for this condition as well. The doctor recommended that Andrea\ncontinue to see the psychiatrist she had seen previously as an outpatient.\nOn 10/1 a 72-Hour conference was held at the foster care agency with the child\nevaluation specialist (CES), the unit supervisor, the supervisor and a worker from the\nfoster care program, a worker from Association for Help of Retarded Children (AHRC),\nand Vincent’s parents. During the conference Andrea produced her discharge form\nfrom the hospital recommending that she follow up at the other hospital with her\npsychiatrist, Dr. D. She said she had been seeing the psychiatrist for about a year. It\nwas reported that Vincent was doing well in his program at AHRC where he was \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 25\nlearning daily living skills and receiving after school care, and community integration\nservices. In discussing plans for Vincent, Andrea could name only her sister, Elizabeth,\nand her mother as possible resources for Vincent, but she requested that neither be\nallowed to have contact with him without going through her. John said he thought\nVincent should return to his mother’s care. The conference ended with Andrea being\nadvised that she must attend therapy weekly and also attend a parenting skills class.\nOn 10/11 both parents went to court where Andrea requested a 1028 hearing for\nVincent. She produced a letter from her therapist, Dr. D., stating that she is being\ntreated for major depressive disorder and has been compliant with therapy. Dr D.\nrecommended that Vincent be reunited with his mother, writing that Andrea is capable\nof caring for her son.\nOn 10/12 the CPS worker made a home visit and met with Andrea. She noted that they\nlived in a clean, spacious one-bedroom apartment\nAndrea visited Vincent at the foster care agency on 10/13. Both were happy to see\neach other, and Vincent asked when he could go home with his mother. She explained\nto him that she couldn’t make any promises. The foster care worker described them as\nhaving a strong positive bond and relating well to each other.\nIn another court hearing on 10/15 Andrea withdrew her 1028 request and asked for\nunsupervised visits with Vincent based on Dr. D’s letter of recommendation. The foster\ncare worker said the visit at the agency had gone well. The judge ordered the CPS\nworker to contact Andrea’s psychiatrist, saying the case would be recalled.\nThat same day the worker called Dr D. who confirmed that he had been seeing Andrea\nfor 2 years, found her to be generally compliant, taking her medications as prescribed.\nNoting that the doctor had not seen Andrea for several months prior to 9/28 when he\nwrote the letter for her, the CPS worker asked if he was aware that Andrea had a\n“mental breakdown” and was hospitalized for this on 1/7, 5/7 and 9/15. The doctor said\nhe was aware and still recommended reunification.\nThe worker then asked if the doctor was aware that when Andrea took the handful of\nZoloft, she did this in the presence of her son. The doctor was unaware of this, but did\nnot change his position. He informed the worker that Andrea’s condition would worsen\nif Vincent remained in care, saying she would become more depressed without him. He\ndid not believe Andrea posed a risk to the safety of Vincent. He had seen her several\ntimes since her hospitalization and reported that she had been compliant with her 30\nminute sessions. When the worker asked why he thought Andrea had not shown up for\ntreatment for several months before this recent hospitalization, the doctor responded,\n“she just stopped coming.” He added that when he saw her on 9/28, Andrea just said\nshe was on “some sort of a trip.” The doctor then ended the call, saying he was\nextremely busy, and disconnected. \n Real Cases Project: The Andrea R. Case Study 26\nWhen the case was recalled in court later that month, the CPS worker informed the\njudge that Andrea’s psychiatrist had not seen her for several months prior to writing the\nletter. The judge then adjourned the case until 2/6/08 and ordered that all visits be\nsupervised. ",

   "summary": "Andrea R. is a 27 year old Caucasian woman who lives with her 9 year old son, Vincent. She is unemployed and receives $23 daily in food stamps, $68.50 biweekly in cash, and $624 monthly for SSI due to Vincent’s autism/chronic asthma. She has been diagnosed at different times with schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, major depression, and epilepsy. In 2002 a social worker at the preschool Vincent was attending made allegations of inadequate guardianship and inadequate food, clothing, and shelter against Andrea. The worker concluded that Andrea lacked knowledge of the child’s developmental needs and referred her to a preventive service agency for services. Andrea denied the allegations, but said she knew who made the report. She had been assaulted by her ex-boyfriend and he was arrested. Andrea lived with her mother when at least 2 reports were made naming her and her siblings as maltreated. The allegations were educational neglect, lack of supervision, and inadequate guardianship. In both cases the sources complained Andrea’s mother smoked crack, left the family alone when she went to buy drugs, and let Andrea and her sister be out on the street. Vincent was removed to the Children’s Center awaiting placement with a relative after the completion of an expedited home study. He was later placed with a voluntary foster care agency. Vincent said that he was afraid his mother was going to turn into a monster, but he did not elaborate as to what he meant. Vincent denied that his mother heard voices or talked to herself. Vincent receives speech, counseling, and occupational therapy at his public school, where he is in special education. On 09/17 the worker also had a face-to-face meeting with Andrea in the hospital, where she seemed heavily sedated. Andrea reported that she took too many Zoloft, but did not know how many. She denied hearing voices and past suicide attempts. Andrea was diagnosed a few years ago with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and epilepsy. Andrea was reportedly under the care of a psychiatrist at that time. Andrea attempted suicide and was in the hospital for at least a month in May or June. Vincent was described by Elizabeth as being very protective of his mother, saying nothing negative about her. Vincent’s father did not appear in court as he had previously promised. Andrea was discharged from inpatient psychiatric unit on 9/25 and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and prescribed Zoloft. Andrea also diagnosed with a seizure disorder and was prescribed medication for this condition. Andrea R. with her psychiatrist, Dr. D., said she had been seeing the psychiatrist for about a year. John said he thought Vincent should return to his mother’s care. The conference ended with Andrea being advised that she must attend therapy weekly and also attend a parenting skills class. Andrea R. was admitted to the hospital on 9/28. She had not shown up for treatment for several months before this recent hospitalization. The doctor told the CPS worker that Andrea’s condition would worsen if Vincent remained in care. The judge then adjourned the case until 2/6/08 and ordered that all visits be supervised.",

   "case_text": "Allegation: Social worker from the hospital that treated Ms M. for injuries resulting from the beatings inflicted on her by her husband during their vacation in Jamaica is concerned about mother's capacity to care for and protect children. Children were present during father's attacks on their mother. Family Background Anne M. is 32 years old woman employed for the past year as a secretary, earning about $30,000 a year. She has been married to Peter M. for 7 years. They have two children, Thomas, aged 6, and Megan, aged 3. Peter is an insurance agent who earns approximately $70,000 a year. Peter and the 2 children are all U.S. citizens. Anne, who\nwas born in Jamaica, is a permanent resident of the US. Peter's family is also from\nJamaica, but he was born in the City. They are both Episcopalians. Since the DV\nincident and subsequent return to the States, Mr. M. has been living in an apartment he\nco-owns with his mother in Brooklyn.\nThere was no prior ACS contact with this family, but a search of Domestic Incident\nReports at the Police department revealed two prior domestic violence incidents in\nwhich Mr. M. was named as the suspect in 12/2002 and 10/2003. \n Real Cases Project: The Anne M. Case Study 28\nCurrent Investigation\nIn the morning of 7/17 child protective service (CPS) worker left phone messages for\nboth Mr. and Ms M. stating her name, contact number, agency, and need to schedule\nan appointment. Mr. M. returned the call at 2:00PM. When the CPS said she was\nconducting an investigation, he asked what the investigation was about and whom did it\ninvolve? The worker responded that she represented ACS and it was necessary for her\nto meet with him to discuss some safety concerns involving his children, Thomas and\nMegan. He explained that he was now living in Brooklyn, but he could be in the Bronx\non Friday and agreed to a morning appointment at the worker's office.\nSince Ms. M. did not return the call, the CPS made an unannounced visit to her\napartment at 6:00 PM on 7/17. She was not at home, but the super agreed to take an\nenvelope for her and said she should be home in 15-20 minutes. The worker waited\nand Ms M. and the children appeared shortly. When the CPS explained the purpose of\nher visit, Ms M. said she was planning to get the children dinner at Burger King and then\ngo to Mr. M.’s apartment with the assistance of the police to serve her husband court\npapers for a temporary Order of Protection. She asked if the interview could take place\nat the restaurant. The worker replied yes, but a home assessment would have to be\nscheduled for the following day. Ms M. said she was very nervous about losing her job,\nbut agreed to a 6:30 AM home visit on 7/18.\nSubject's Account of Allegation\nMs M. said her husband inflicted bruises on her on 7/10 in the presence of the children\nduring their vacation in Jamaica. When the CPS asked what was going on between her\nand her husband when this incident occurred, Ms M. explained that an old friend of hers\ncalled the week after they arrived and offered to show the family around. Her husband\ngave the friend directions to the house where they were staying, but when he arrived,\nMr. M. said he didn't want to go and offered to stay home with the children. They were\ngone for about 3 hours, but when they returned her husband pulled the friend out of the\ncar and assaulted him. He was then arrested and stayed one night in jail.\nSeveral days later they got into an argument because he left no money for her when he\nwent out alone, although he knew she needed to buy food for the dish she was cooking,\nand she was counting on his taking the children with him. When he came back, she\nyelled at him; he then came at her with a closed fist, saying he saw her friend's car\nwaiting outside. He punched her repeatedly in the face, neck, shoulders and arms as\nhe was shouting, \"You're making a fool out of me\" and \"You ruin my vacation.\" She\nrealized she was bleeding all over and there was blood on the walls and the floor.\nWhen she went into the shower, he continued punching her. He finally left, saying he\nwas going to kill her friend.\nShe tried to call the police by dialing 999, but got no response so she ran with the\nchildren to an upstairs apartment. He came back and was banging at the door with a\nbrick so she decided to open the door before he got any angrier. She saw a knife in his \n Real Cases Project: The Anne M. Case Study 29\npocket, but he saw the one she was holding. When he yelled, \"let's go at it,\" she\ndropped her knife.\nHer husband picked the knife up and held her in a choke hold while the children were\nscreaming. He then became very frustrated with the children, screaming at them to\nshut up. When they did not stop, he took off his belt and started hitting them very hard.\nShe tried to stop him from beating the children by jumping in front of them where she\nwas hit across the back, neck and waist with the belt.\nAt that point the police arrived, alerted by a neighbor that it sounded like someone was\ntrying to kill a woman. The police reportedly told her that if she had her husband\narrested, she would be too because it takes two people to fight. They also told her if she\nwanted to press charges, she would have to stay in Jamaica to present evidence, they\ndidn't know for how long.\nShe was able to get a flight to New York City for herself and the children early the next\nmorning, 7/15. That evening she sought medical attention for herself and the children.\nThe triage nurse in the ER called the police who interviewed Ms M. and the children and\nobserved the bruises. However, they said they could just keep a note on file. Because\nthe incident occurred out of the country, they could not arrest Mr. M. They told Ms M.\nshe should go to Family Court and get an Order of Protection for herself and the\nchildren.\nOn 7/16 Ms M. went to Family Court and obtained a temporary Order of Protection for\nthe children, herself, the children's day care provider, baby sitter, and various family\nmembers.\nInitial Home Visit\nAt the home visit, it was clear that this 2-bedroom apartment was clean, well organized\nand furnished, with plenty of food in the refrigerator, locks and guards on the windows,\nand smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Ms M. was able to show the worker the\nchildren's vaccination records and said the children have no special medical or mental\nhealth needs. Since the children share a twin bed in the 2nd bedroom, the worker\nexplained why this was not a good idea and said she would help Ms M. get a set of\nbunk beds for the children.\nThe worker looked at the medical report Ms M. was given. The doctor wrote that Ms M.\nhad a perforated ear drum with nerve damage, possibly resulting in some hearing loss,\nas well as bruises over her right eye requiring some stitches.\nThe CPS worker observed the children for marks and bruises. Both of the children had\nvisible welts on their backs and arms. Thomas reported that \"daddy hit me hard there,\nand it still hurts. When I was going upstairs, daddy hit me on the back and I was crying\nso he hit me again.\" Megan said, \"daddy hit me right there,\" pointing to the welts on her \n Real Cases Project: The Anne M. Case Study 30\narm, \"daddy did it.\" When the CPS asked her if she could tell her what happened,\nMegan put her hands over her ears and said, \"don't talk, don't talk.\"\nMs M. described her fear about her husband entering the apartment, explaining that\nbefore entering the apartment she leaves the children standing at the front door and\ndials 911 on her cell phone; she leaves the number on ready, so it can be pushed in an\nemergency. She then does a walk through of the apartment to insure her husband is not\nthere.\nSafety Plan\nThe worker discussed safety plans with Ms. M. She recommended that Ms. M. gather\nall vital documents in one safe place, pack a change of clothes for her and the children,\nhave sufficient cash available in case she has to move in a hurry, and identify a place\nshe can go unknown to her husband. Ms. M. agreed to these suggestions, saying she\nwill request the assistance of a friend she has known for many years and will arrange a\ncode word so others will know to call the police immediately if she calls and is in danger.\nMs. M. had already obtained an Order of Protection, but since she had difficulty serving\nhim, the worker suggested she hire a process server.\nMs. M purchased new locks for both doors and requested help in getting them installed.\nThe worker agreed to this, but suggested she might want to explore the possibility of\nother apartments with her landlord. Ms M. said she is not willing to do that at the\nmoment because she likes the apartment and the community and feels safe once she\nenters and locks the door from the inside.\nCourt Involvement\nBecause of the safety concerns, the worker checked with a legal consultant in the\nagency and was told to prepare a complete W865d. Once this was reviewed, it was\ndecided there were sufficient grounds for a neglect petition (Article 10) against Mr. M.\nThe worker completed a COI (Court Ordered Investigation) and the court date was\nscheduled for 7/20. At the initial hearing Ms M. was assigned an 18B lawyer, and the\ncase was adjourned for a week.\nMr. M. refused to attend either court hearing. When he talked with the worker, he said a\nfriend who works for ACS told him there was something wrong with this hearing. \"What\nis this court date about?\" When the worker explained the hearing involves the safety\nconcerns ACS has about his children, he responded: \"I know my wife must have\nreported that while we were on vacation, I hit my kids. She's angry and reported that I\nhit them in the US because she wants me arrested.\" When the worker asked if he could\nexplain what happened, he said, \"We went on vacation and she disrespected me by\ngoing on a date with another man... I was fighting with my wife and I took off my belt\nand hit my kids. I know I hit them, but I don’t abuse my kids.\" The worker told him it\nwas in his best interest to go to the court hearing. She also informed him that an Order\nof Protection has been issued, which means he must not contact them, go to their \n Real Cases Project: The Anne M. Case Study 31\nresidence or the children's school. He is to make no contact and is to stay away from\nthem.\nAt the 856 hearing on 7/20, the children were paroled to their mother on condition of\nweekly ACS supervision with announced and unannounced visits. Respondent father\nwas to have supervised visitation with the children upon consent of the law guardian.\nAnd children were to be evaluated, especially for play therapy. (The children did not\nwant to see their father at this time, but it was hoped they would be able to move\nbeyond this incident once they were enrolled in therapy).\nAt the Article 10 hearing on 8/8, the earlier orders were continued. No decision was\nmade because Mr. M. did not have an attorney; and the judge said he could not have a\ncourt-appointed lawyer because of his income. The hearing was continued until 8/20.\nWhen he appeared at this hearing, Mr. M. still did not have an attorney. The judge\ninformed him if he appeared again without a lawyer, he would have to represent himself.\nOngoing Contacts\nDuring the approximate 6 weeks after the initial investigation, the CPS worker had 3\nvisits with the family, made 3 additional unannounced evening visits but no one was\nhome, and had numerous telephone conversations with Ms. M. and related others. The\nworker’s supervisors reviewed her activities several times during this time. She also\ntried to arrange an Elevated Risk conference with a child evaluation specialist (CES).\nThis conference was never held because the CES worker was unable to work out a time\nwith Ms. M. due to her work schedule and child care issues.\nDuring this same period the CPS worker received at least 7 calls from Ms. M. Her calls\ninvolved checking on the phone number of the law guardian assigned to the children,\nrequesting help with the children’s day care fees because she wasn’t sure her husband\nwould pay, and reports of a couple of text messages she received from her husband.\nAlso, since the department had provided mattresses and bunk beds for the children,\nseveral of her calls related to the fact that her daughter had a severe allergic reaction to\nthe bed bugs in the new mattress. (The worker eventually arranged for replacement\nmattresses).\nThe worker’s calls and visits were focused primarily on the children’s welfare and\nresponse to the domestic violence incident. She also followed up to make sure Ms. M.\nhad contacted the domestic violence program to which she had been referred. During\nher visit on 8/3 she talked with the children and then asked them to go play in their\nroom. When the worker commented that Ms. M. must be concerned her husband was\nnot following the Order of Protection, Thomas ran into the room and turned the TV up\nloud. When the worker asked why he had done this, he ran to his mother and put his\nhead on the couch. His mother said that whenever his sister mentions daddy, he says\n“no more daddy” and turns the TV up loud. \n Real Cases Project: The Anne M. Case Study 32\nThe worker made a visit to the children’s day care program to discuss the children’s\nprogress. She was told that there had been no real change in the children’s behavior.\nWhen she learned that Ms. M. had only given a copy of the Order of Protection to the\nhead teacher, she said that each teacher should have a copy and called Ms. M. to\nremind her she must give each person a copy in order to protect the children.\nOn 8/17 the worker met with the family and the children’s maternal grandmother (whom\nMs. M. had named as her main support) at the day care center. During that meeting\nMs. M. said she wanted to look for a new apartment. She was very nervous about\nstaying in her current home. Ms. M. told the worker she would like to get some\ncounseling for herself because she keeps having flashbacks to DV incident in Jamaica.\nShe is worried that the children may also be having flashbacks and thinks they should\nhave counseling too. When asked what she does to relieve her anxiety, she said she\nprays.\nOn 8/17 in the evening, the worker met with the mother and the children at the home of\nthe babysitter whom Ms. M. had hired to cover while she is looking for a new apartment.\nAlthough she still seemed very anxious, the children were reportedly doing well and\nrelated comfortably to the worker.\nElevated Risk Conference\nOn 8/30 an Elevated Risk Conference was held with Ms. M, the worker, and a child\nevaluation specialist. They discussed the history of domestic violence in the family. Ms.\nM. said they had several incidents in the past when her husband would get very angry,\nbump her and put his finger in her face. Thomas would run into the middle of them and\nsay, “Don’t talk to my mommy like that.” Mr. M. would then go to the apartment he\nshares with his mother in Brooklyn for the weekend. There were two prior complaint of\ndomestic violence in 2002 and 2003 when Ms. M. called the police after fights in which\nhe hit and choked her. However, the incident in Jamaica was the only one in which\ntheir father hurt the children physically in any way.\nMs. M. said Megan is very anxious to see her father and keeps asking to call daddy.\nShe sometimes plays with toys and calls them daddy. She covers her ears if anyone\ngets loud. Thomas is willing to talk with his father, but he doesn’t want to see him. Ms.\nM. wants her children to see their father, but she doesn’t know how they can ever have\na normal relationship.\nShe also mentioned that before the incident in Jamaica, they had a very close\nrelationship with her husband’s brothers and they are her children’s godfathers. They\nhaven’t said anything to her since the incident, but she is afraid to have her children visit\nthem because their father may be there.\nThe child evaluation specialist said it was very important to get Mr. M. involved in\nservices such as anger management and batterers’ counseling. The plan\nrecommended was that the CPS worker would continue monitoring the family, make \n Real Cases Project: The Anne M. Case Study 33\nstrenuous attempts to engage Mr. M, and follow up on the referral of Mrs. M. to a\ndomestic violence program.\nA formal supervisory review was held on 8/31. It was noted that Mrs. M. response to\nthe domestic violence was more than appropriate. She was always focused on\nsafeguarding the children and removing them from the potential for more damage. She\nis looking forward to becoming engaged with a preventive service program that can help\nher deal with the domestic violence and other family needs. ",

   "case_text": "Allegation: The boy’s mother, Susan, alleged that Mary S., the boy’s maternal\ngrandmother and legal guardian, is physically abusive and intimidating to 15yr old\nJason. Yesterday 9-28-07, she reportedly punched the adolescent in the face after she\ntold him to clean his bedroom. This is not the first time Mary has used physical force to\nintimidate Jason. He is afraid of his grandmother, as she has threatened to shoot him if\nhe ever hits her back. Also, the grandmother goes out of town for days at a time and\ndoes not leave Jason any money for food. The last time she left was on Saturday and\nshe did not return until Monday. Mary does not make an alternate plan for Jason’s care\nwhen she travels out of state.”\nJason’s mother, Susan, says she and her husband gave custody of him to her mother\nwhen she was 17 because they did not have any health insurance. Susan says she\nwent to court and filed a petition to revoke her mother’s guardianship and the next court\ndate is October 26, 2007. However, she has to serve her mother the paperwork first.\nSusan says her mother is a retired New York State corrections officer, and she may still\nhave her weapon.” \n Real Cases Project: The Mary S. Case Study 36\nFamily Background\nThis African American family consists of the 53 year-old maternal grandmother, Mary;\nher 32year old daughter, Susan; Susan’s 15year old son, Jason; her 9 and 5 year old\nsons; her 43 year old companion, Stanley; and Stanley’s 2 daughters, aged 13 and 18.\nMary is a retired corrections officer. She receives $6400.00/month in pension benefits\nand an undisclosed amount from disability. Mary has diabetes and high blood pressure\nand takes medication for the condition. Mary was granted legal guardianship of Jason\nin December 1992, when Susan was 17-years old. It was documented that Susan and\nJason’s father signed over guardianship to Mary, so that Jason could be covered by her\nmedical insurance. Since that time, Jason has alternated between living with Susan and\nwith Mary. Susan moved to Chicago while Mary continues to reside in NY. Jason’s\nfather is deceased; the cause of death was not mentioned.\nIn the summer of 2006, Jason asked to live with Mary and has resided with her ever\nsince. Susan filed a petition in June 2007 for modification of guardianship that was\nawarded to Mary in 1992, but the case was dismissed because she failed to appear in\ncourt. In September 2007, she filed another petition regarding the matter of\nguardianship; the judge requested that ACS submit a COI (Court Ordered Investigation)\nby October 21, 2007.\nA courtesy visit to Susan’s home was conducted by Illinois Child Protective Services\ndue to the COI request. Susan resides in Chicago suburb with Stanley, her two other\nsons and Stanley’s two children. They live in a two-story home with three bedrooms.\nThe home was equipped with carbon monoxide/smoke detectors however there were\nno window guards. Susan works at a grocery store and earns $650.00/bi-weekly.\nStanley works at a hardware store and earns $800.00/bi-weekly. Stanley has a criminal\nbackground. During 1984-1989, he was arrested for attempted robbery, resisting arrest\nand possession of stolen property. He was imprisoned in 1989 and paroled in 1992.\nMary and Jason reside in 3-story private home in Upper Manhattan. The living room\nand kitchen are on the first floor. The worker observed food in the refrigerator. The\nfamily room Jason’s bedroom, bathroom and laundry room are located on the second\nfloor. Jason’s room is equipped with a full size bed, dresser, desk and closet. Mary\nlives on the third floor, which has an office, bathroom and bedroom. The home, which is\nwell kept and neat, is equipped with a smoke/carbon monoxide detector.\nJason is dark-skinned, slightly overweight, average height, and has a short haircut. He\nbegan a new Catholic high school this month. Mary pays the tuition for his school. He\nwas reportedly left back in the 6th grade while residing with his mother due to excessive\nabsences. Jason is active in sports and plays baseball. This past summer he\nparticipated in baseball camp, karate class and weight training. In addition, he attended\ntutoring for math and English, once a week. The CPS worker observed that he was free\nfrom marks and bruises. Reportedly, he has had no developmental delays or\ndisabilities, and no mental health needs. \n Real Cases Project: The Mary S. Case Study 37\nCurrent Investigation\nThe S. Family first became known to ACS on 9/29/07, at 6:06 p.m. when the mother of\nthe alleged maltreated child filed a complaint with the State Central Registry. At 6:08 an\nEmergency Children’s Services worker was assigned the case for intake. When the\ncase was received, the CPS conducted family clearances in WMS, CCRS, ACRS+,\nLTS, and the SCR. It was noted that the alleged subject, Mary S. is listed in\nConnections as a foster parent.\nCPS called the source of the report in Illinois to confirm the allegations. The source, the\nalleged maltreated child’s mother, confirmed what was reported, and also informed the\nCPS that she filed a petition with Family Court to terminate the guardianship rights of\nMary S. She told the CPS worker that she had her other two children in her care, she\nhad not relinquished her parental rights of Jason, and she is seeking to have him live\nwith her again. She also disclosed that Jason often called her crying and told her that\nhe fears his grandmother. Jason told her that Mary S. punched him in the face for not\ncleaning his room fast enough when he was asked to. She said this incident was not the\nfirst time Mary S. has used excessive corporal punishment while disciplining Jason.\nThe source also disclosed that Mary S. has left Jason home alone for days at a time,\nthe last incident having taken place the week before when she traveled to Boston\nwithout him. Mary S. reportedly left Jason without adult supervision and money for\nfood. The source expressed her concern for Jason’s safety and well being, because\nMary S. is a retired corrections officer that might still have a gun in the home.\nLater that evening on 9/29 at 11:21 p.m., another worker attempted an unannounced\nhome visit to the case address, but was unsuccessful. The CPS worker attempted to\nmake contact with anyone who might have been at the case address by repeatedly\nusing the intercom that was located at the top of the stairs, as well as calling the home\ntelephone number listed on the intake report.\nThe case was reassigned to the Manhattan field office the morning of 9/30 and\nassigned to a CPS worker who attempted an initial home visit at 5:00 P.M. There was\nno one home then, but the worker made face-to-face contact with the family at 7:30 AM\nthe next morning, 10/1\nInterviews\nOn 10/1/07, the CPS worker interviewed Mary and Jason at their home address. She\nexplained the reason for the CPS visit and asked Mary to discuss her relationship with\nJason. Mary began by saying that she and Jason get into conflicts because he does\nnot listen. She stated that he did not clean his room or bathroom and did not do his\nhomework when he was supposed to. Mary informed the CPS that she has had legal\ncustody of Jason since his birth. She showed the CPS the court documents and the\nletters Jason’s parents wrote to the court. Until 2004, Jason lived with Susan. In the\nsummer of 2004, Jason visited her with his two brothers and stayed with her since that\ntime. The worker inquired about the reason why he stayed, and Mary stated that \n Real Cases Project: The Mary S. Case Study 38\nSusan’s boyfriend, Stanley, punched Jason in the stomach. Mary stated she does not\nlike the way Stanley treats the children. She also said that all of the children wanted to\nstay with her, but Susan would not allow it.\nJason told her that Stanley had his older son get a knife and cut his younger brother on\nthe back of the foot. He also told her Stanley knelt down and punched him in the face.\nThe 9 year old reportedly saw a gun in Susan and Stanley’s bedroom. She said she\nhas told Stanley not to put his hands on her grandchildren. She asks her grandchildren\nif anyone has bothered them, but the children are “afraid to disclose any information.”\nShe feels Susan does not protect the children. Mary S. contacted the Child Protective\nServices in Chicago, but they did nothing.\nMary continued that she is very strict with Jason because she wants the best for him.\nShe did not feel that that he would do well living with Susan. He was left back in the 6th\ngrade because Susan allowed him to miss 34 days of school. Mary stated she lives for\nher grandchildren. Jason has his own phone and is allowed to speak with his mother at\nanytime. Mary said Jason’s problem is that he is lazy and does not like to do what he is\ntold. She sent Jason away to baseball camp last summer and had him participate in\nweight training.\nThe CPS worker asked Mary if she punched Jason in the face. She stated that she told\nhim to clean-up, but got fed up with him and punched him in the face. The worker\nasked if she hits him often, and she said that she has hit him only five times in his life.\nShe usually yells at him or takes things away. She denied leaving any marks or bruises\non him. She also denied hitting him with an object, but said when he was little, she\nspanked him with a belt. Mary told the CPS that she has diabetes and high blood\npressure so she cannot get worked up. When the worker asked if they get along except\nfor cleaning issues, she said yes.\nMary explained that she is trying to rescue Jason from being a deadbeat. He has no\npositive male influences, and she is trying her best to teach him dignity. She does not\nwant to hurt him, she just wants him to grow up and be something. Mary admitted that\nshe becomes hot headed when Jason does not listen. The worker asked if she thought\nJason would benefit from counseling, and she stated she would be willing to accept\nservices. Mary refused to provide her social security number and sign the HIPPA form,\nbut she gave the contact information for Jason’s physician.\nThe worker met with Jason and first asked him about his summer. He relayed the he\nattended baseball camp, karate class, and weight training. He also said that he has\nfriends and speaks with them on the phone or when he goes outside. When asked if he\nlikes his new high school, he said that he has made a lot of friends because of his\ninvolvement in sports. The worker asked Jason to describe his relationship with\ngrandmother, and he said they get into disagreements because he does not do what he\nis told. He does not clean his room and bathroom when she asks. When the worker\nasked him if he liked living with his grandmother, he responded that he did, but missed\nhis brothers. Asked if he wanted to live with his mother, he replied, “of course, what \n Real Cases Project: The Mary S. Case Study 39\nchild doesn’t.” He continued that he wished he could live with both his mother and\ngrandmother, but knew it was impossible. The worker asked why and he said “because\nthey do not get along.”\nJason informed the CPS that he saw his brothers in June for his birthday and\ngraduation. He also stated that he went to Chicago for his spring break. He stated he\nspeaks with his mother daily. The worker asked Jason if he was scared of his\ngrandmother, and he said no. Asked how he is disciplined, he said that his\ngrandmother yells and curses at him. She hit him recently because he did not do what\nhe was told. When asked where he was hit, he replied that she punched him in the\nface. The worker asked Jason about the last time she hit him, and he said about a year\nago. In addition, she has thrown a boot at him, and it hit him in the arm. The worker\nasked if his grandmother threatened him, and he replied that she told him she will shoot\nhim if he hits her. The worker asked if she has a gun, and he said he did not know.\nThe CPS asked if he ever stayed home alone and he said, ‘no.’\nThe worker attempted to contact his mother, the source, but she was unable to reach\nher. She contacted the pediatrician, Dr. S, who confirmed that Jason was seen on\n6/29/2007. Dr. S. stated Jason has been coming to his office since October 2004, when\nhe moved in with Mary. He relayed that he has never seen any marks and bruises on\nJason. The CPS asked Dr. S if he suspected that Jason was abused and he said, “no.”\nOn 10/7/07, the CPS met the source, Susan, in court and spoke with her about the\ncase. The CPS asked Susan to discuss the issues and she responded that Jason is\nconstantly calling her stating he wants to come home. Jason has made continuous\ncomplaints about his grandmother cursing at him and not feeding him every day. Susan\nstated that she does not like what is going on. The only reason she allowed Jason to\nstay since 2004 was because he asked to, but now he hates his grandmother. The\nworker asked how she knew he was punched in the face, and she said he called her\ncrying about it. She added that Jason had wanted to stay with his grandmother to\ncomplete junior high school and return to Chicago for high school. She is petitioning to\nterminate guardianship and that was the reason she was in court.\nThe worker received a message from Mary regarding the petition that Susan filed for\ncustody. When she spoke with Mary in court, Mary said she does not want Susan to\nobtain custody. She feels that Jason will not have the same opportunities if he leaves.\nShe just wants him to graduate from high school, and then he can do whatever he\nwants.\nOn 10/10, the CPS received a request for a Court Ordered Investigation that was due\non 10/21/07. Also, the court ordered the Child Protective Office in Illinois to complete a\nhome study. On 10/14, the CPS worker contacted Mary’s sister, Dorothy E. and asked\nher to describe her sister as a grandmother. Dorothy stated that her sister is very\ncaring, supportive and concerned for her grandchildren. She stated that she has never\nobserved any marks or bruises on Jason. She said Mary and Jason are close, and he\nnever said he was abused. Asked if she knew where Jason wanted to live, she replied \n Real Cases Project: The Mary S. Case Study 40\nprobably with his mother because he misses his brothers. However, Dorothy believes\nthat residing with Mary would be the best for him because he is more adequately cared\nfor. The CPS asked Dorothy if Mary uses drugs and alcohol. Dorothy stated that Mary\nwas a corrections officer and a role model for the family. The worker asked if she had\nany concerns for the child, and she responded that she is worried that all of these\ncurrent issues may affect Jason psychologically.\nThe CPS worker contacted Mary’s neighbor, Mr. B. to discuss his relationship with her.\nMr. B. stated that he has been friendly with Mary for eight years. The CPS asked what\nMr. B’s perception of Jason was, and he relayed that Jason is a good and happy child.\nHe stated that Mary is a good caretaker and takes adequate care of Jason. The CPS\nasked Mr. B. if Jason disclosed that he was abused and he replied no. Mr. B. stated\nthat Jason had his phone number and was told if he needed to discuss male issues to\ncontact Mr. B. Mr. B. denied having seen any marks or bruises on Jason. He denied\nany knowledge of Mary abusing drugs or alcohol. He stated that Mary keeps to herself\nand rarely has guests over to her home. The CPS asked if Mr. B. had any concerns for\nJason and he said no.\nThe CPS worker called Diane G., a friend of Susan’s for a reference. Diane said that\nshe has been friendly with Susan for four years. The CPS asked Diane how often she\nsees Susan’s boys, and she said she sees them often. She said that the children\nappear happy and they were clean. Diane stated she has not observed any marks and\nbruises on the children. She felt the kids are well cared for. “Susan is a good mother,\nvery caring, and always there for her children.” Asked if she had ever met Jason, she\nsaid yes. Jason gets along well with his mother, and they are respectful towards each\nother. The worker asked if Susan misused drugs and alcohol, and she said no. Also,\nshe stated that Susan did not have people coming in and out of the home.\nThe CPS contacted Tara J., another friend of Susan’s. Tara said that she has known\nSusan for two years. She does not see the children often, but she speaks with Susan\noften. Tara denied knowing of any drug/alcohol use. She has never observed any\nmark or bruises on the children. Tara stated that Susan is very good with her children\nso she does not have any concerns. She feels that Susan could care for all the children\nincluding Jason. She said she has never suspected any abuse and thinks the children\nare well taken care of.\nOn 10/19 the worker made an unannounced visit to Mary’s home. She asked Mary how\nthings have been going. She responded that Jason has been doing well in school thus\nfar. Mary denied that Jason was acting any differently since their last court date. She\nsaid he has been his normal self. Mary told the worker that they return to court on\n10/26, and she will let the judge make the decision. She would not fight the decision,\nbut she is still not in agreement with Jason living with his mother. She wants what is\nbest for him, but does not feel that it is with his mother.\nThe worker spoke with Jason about school, and he said it was fine. Asked if he was\nworried about the court matter, he said that he did not feel his grandmother and mother \n Real Cases Project: The Mary S. Case Study 41\nshould be in court. “They should settle it within the family.” Asked what he wanted the\noutcome to be, he stated that he wanted to go with his mother. He misses his brothers\nand his mother. The worker then asked how he felt about his grandmother, and he said\nhe felt the same. He knows that his grandmother just wants him to make something out\nof himself and that she had his best interest in mind. He denied having any recent\narguments and being hit by Mary. The worker asked when he last spoke with his\nmother, and he said the night before. Asked how he felt when he spoke to her, he said\nthat he was happy but sad when he would hang up.\nThe CPS asked Jason if he liked Stanley, and he said yes. Jason stated that he was\nnice and that they get along. Asked if Stanley ever hit him, he said yes. On one\noccasion Stanley punched him in the face because he was not listening. Another time,\nStanley punched him in the chest, in the presence of his mother “for being smart to\nhim.” His mother did not say anything because he was being disrespectful. When the\nworker said to Jason, “and you still like him,” he replied, yes, because Stanley provides\nfor him and his brothers. Also, Stanley buys food and clothes for them. He stated that\nStanley is like a father figure since his father died.\nThe CPS asked if Stanley ever hit his brothers, and he said they have gotten a few\nspankings. They were hit with a belt. Jason then described an instance where Stanley\nbeat the 9 year old because Susan was too upset. He was beaten for two minutes\nbecause he stole money from his mother’s bag. Asked if his mother hit him, he said\nyes, but only on serious cases. He was spanked a few times, but usually his mother\ntalks to him or takes something away from him.\nOn 10/21, the CPS worker submitted the COI to the Manhattan Family Court. On\n10/28/07, the CPS left a message for Mary regarding the outcome of the court hearing.",

The children's father was contacted and said he was willing to take care of the children, but he has had little contact with them since the separation. Concerned about the risk of harm to the children, FACS removed the children and placed them into care and made an application to the Children’s Court to have interim parental responsibility for the children.

This shows a significant history of domestic abuse, relating to both the mother’s current partner, and to the father of Hannah and Ella.

   "case_text": "Case Study 1 - NCC Early Help for Disabled Children. Background / Story:\nAt point of referral there were five children in the family with ages ranging from one to ten. The mother lives\nwith the father of the younger three children and the two older children, who do not have contact with their\nbiological fathers, view their mother’s partner as their father. The case was referred to Early Help after an\nunsuccessful referral to Social Care for neglect. The children had been previously referred into Social Care due\nto allegations of neglect and physical abuse on several occasions and there had been a Child Protection Plan in\n2013.\nThe lead child (A) is the second eldest child. He has a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n(ADHD) and is on the Autistic Spectrum (ASD). At the point of referral A was being home-schooled following\nexclusion from a complementary education setting. He has previously attended three mainstream primary\nschools. He had been aggressive to other pupils and staff. In addition he had self harmed in school. At point of\nreferral, the family had never received support from additional agencies with Child A’s ADHD or ASD.\nHistorically, prior to the diagnosis of ADHD and ASD, some professionals had suggested that child A’s poor\nbehaviour was a result of neglect and poor attachment with his mother. The parents do not experience\nbehavioural difficulties with any of the other children although there have been concerns about the children’s\nphysical appearance and conditions in the home. Schools have previously reported Child A to present as a\n‘scared and damaged child’. In addition there have been concerns regarding his presentation and personal\nhygiene. The Early Help Assessment (EHA) had identified that the parents struggle to bathe him. In addition\nthey report finding it hard to ensure he wears fresh clothes every day.\nAs part of the EHA, all the other children were seen individually. The elder children have good school\nattendance and were progressing in their academic studies. All children were up to date with their\nimmunisations and were reported to be in good health by both the GP and Health Visitor. All of the children\nreported their love for each other and suggested that they were comfortable and felt safe in their home.\nIntervention:\nCompletion of the Graded Care Profile and direct feedback to parents was undertaken to consider the quality\nof care in the family and to look for evidence of neglect through conversations, with parent, the impact of\nChild A’s disabilities and lack of appropriate provision became apparent. These difficulties were having a\ndirect impact on the care parents were able to provide to all the children.\nThe situation regarding the parents’ ongoing decoration of a new home was explored. The house was lacking\ncarpets and the decor needed updating. To assist parents in purchasing the required items Early Help for\nDisabled Children funded new bed sheets and winter duvets for all of the children.\nParents were helped to apply for an appropriate specialist provision for Child A. Parents were initially\ninformed they could not have their preferred placement due to transport. This required liaison with the\nEducation, Health and Care Plan Coordinator and area SEN officer to obtain transport.\nAs a result of liaison with CAMHS in regards to Child A’s medication a number of medication changes were\nmade through the course of the intervention and the impact of this was recognisable in both Child A’s\nbehaviour and sleeping pattern. This had a direct impact on the presentation of the other children.\nLiaison with the new secondary school, for the eldest child (B), ensured a suitable transition programme was\nin place in light of his previous attendance issues.\n38\nA School Mentor was put in place in regards to Child B. This was set up to encourage Child B to have regular\nattendance following occasions where he left the school site and also reported incidents of bullying.\nProtective Behaviour work undertaken with the older girls of the family, particularly one of the daughters who\nwas reported to have begun her periods at the age of 7.\nKey Features:\nHistorically a number of referrals had been made to Social Care regarding unexplained injuries. A number of\ninjuries were received by Child D, through the course of the intervention. Timely liaison with parents and\nprofessionals enabled the practitioner to identify that these were indeed accidental injuries, mainly caused\nthrough Child A’s behaviour. The Graded Care Profile identified that Child A’s safety was often compromised\ndue to his own lack of self awareness.\nParents had received a number of parenting interventions including Family Intervention Project. Use of the\nGraded Care Profile, in respect of Child A, established that the lack of appropriate resources in place to meet\nthe needs arising from his disability was having a direct impact on the parents’ ability to succeed through\nthese interventions.\nAs part of completing the Graded Care Profile, observations were made of parents’ interactions with each of\nthe children. Observations and additional 1:1 sessions with the children determined that they were happy in\ntheir home environment and that they felt love and warmth from their parents.\nConsistent monitoring and observations of the family over a 6 month period allowed for a pattern in\ndeteriorating home conditions to be recognised. During the course of the intervention it became apparent\nthat during low periods and significant events in the family, the home conditions deteriorated. This included\nMother’s low emotional wellbeing. Completion of the Graded Care Profile during a relatively steady period\nidentified that home conditions can meet to an adequate standard.\nReports had previously been made in regards to the children’s access to food. The Graded Care Profile\nhighlighted concerns in regard to the infrequent preparation of meals. 1:1 work with all the children\nestablished that appropriate foods were available to the children including fresh home cooked meals.\nUnannounced visits at meal times also enabled the practitioner to observe that healthy and freshly prepared\nmeals were provided by the mother.\nImpact on Outcomes:\nChild A continues to successfully attend his specialist provision. A 1:1 Key Worker is provided with whom he\nhas built a good relationship. This has contributed to his improved behaviour in the home.\nChild A is now on suitable medication for his needs. It has taken some time to establish the best program for\nhis needs but the regular input from CAMHS has ensured that changes have been made when required. This\nhas resulted in improved behaviour and has also had a positive impact on Child B’s ability to sleep whilst\nsharing a room with Child A.\nThe Protective Behaviour work completed with the older girls and sessions with the nurse have offered\nreassurance that the girls can keep themselves safe by liaising with school staff and their parents.\nAll children’s school attendance, other than the eldest Child B, has significantly improved. This was a direct\nresult of Child A being in specialist provision and no longer home-schooled. Appropriate routines are in place\nfor all children.\nNow it has been established there are no specific causes for concern in regards to Child B’s wellbeing, a\nparenting contract is in place and a managed move to the child’s school of choice is being considered.\n39\nAttendance at the local children’s centre was encouraged. Two Year Old funding was available, for the\nyoungest child.\nToward the end of the intervention the home was observed to be nearly fully decorated. Bedding was\nprovided and in place for all the children. Beds were observed to be appropriately covered over a number of\nvisits.\nFeedback from the primary schools is now that they have no concerns in regards to the children’s general\nappearances and personal hygiene.",

   "case_text": "Case Study 2 – Children’s Social Care Background/ Story: In this case, a previous neglect based referral had been made, resulting in No Further Action to Children’s Social Care in the MASH. School attendance was 80% and mother failed to collect Child A on two occasions. Mother’s behaviour was noted to be erratic and the home conditions were reported by school staff to be cluttered and foul smelling, with unsafe items including a guillotine, cutting tools and other items within easy reach. A family dog was observed as being caged beneath the stairs. At this stage an EHA was advised. The referral raised contained concerns about the levels of care afforded to Child A following intervention from the Early Help Team which included parental disguised compliance. Child A’s mother had not been able to make identified and required positive changes to address the concerns raised in the referral regarding neglectful parenting - including the flat being dirty, limited food within the home and Child A not attending school regularly / on time. Child A’s mother’s engagement with services was identified as sporadic and she avoided professional contact, including contacts with Mental Health Workers. Child A’s mother did not engage with the Initial Assessment and, as such, a Core Assessment was required to explore the mother’s ability to meet her daughter’s needs on a consistent basis. Intervention: The Core Assessment was completed in September 2015 and, as a result, a Child in Need Plan was implemented, with regular CIN meetings held. Child A had a place in the school’s Nurture Group to promote her continued emotional development and also attended extra-curricular activities at school to promote her emotional and social development including a Breakfast Club to ensure she had eaten before school and to encourage punctual attendance. Commissioned Family Support has been put in place to support Child A’s mother to develop positive routines, monitor home conditions and promote mother’s independence. The Graded Care Profile was used as the tool to undertake this task. In addition to this, a Parenting Assessment is on-going to compliment the use of Graded Care Profile Assessment. Key features: Child A’s mother understands the concerns that have been raised and there is no doubt that she wants to be a good mother to her daughter. However services involved continue to find her difficult to engage with, and the positive changes made are rarely fully sustained over a period of time. Child A has said to professionals that she likes ‘Writing’ and Maths and that she has lots of friends at school and near her Grandma’s house. She also said that she has hot dinners at school and she enjoys these, she especially likes chicken dippers. Child A said that when she is not at school, she likes to do puzzles and enjoys playing outside with her friends on her bike. She is proud that she can ride her bike without stabilisers and said that she goes down the hill ‘really fast'. She also said that she can do cart-wheels, hand-stands and rolypolys. Child A has also spoken about never feeling sad and that she feels happy when she sees her cousin as she enjoys playing with him. She also advised that her Uncle keeps her safe because ‘he got rid of a spider’.  Impact on outcomes: Child A’s attendance at school has improved and she has benefitted from the time spent in Nurture Group. Commissioned Family Support continue to work with Child A’s mother to improve home conditions, impose positive routines, ensure that there is sufficient nutritious food in the home and work with mother to promote her independence. The Graded Care Profile is completed regularly and key actions identified to improve outcomes for Child A based on this. Child A now spends more time at home, rather than at her Grandmother's house. Her mother’s lack of engagement with professionals has been addressed, along with an issue of collusion from her maternal Grandmother. These controlling behaviours from her maternal Grandmother have been addressed by a number of pieces of work undertaken. There are now positive routines and stability for Child A helping her reach her potential and achieve in school and at home.",

Her parents showed her very little love and affection and there were no games or learning experiences in her home. Most days, Maddie was left to her own devices, charged with feeding, entertaining and caring for herself.  Due to the abusive nature of her home, Maddie was removed from her parents and now lives with her grandmother. As a result of the ongoing trauma, her speech and language was severely delayed and later she suffered separation anxiety from her grandmother, and was unable to safely leave her side. Maddie only communicated with her grandmother using gestures such as pointing, and very basic single words.  She doesn’t always understand her feelings; they’re big, loud, and overwhelming. Every Monday, Maddie has been receiving speech therapy and psychological support from Act for Kids to build on her relationship with her grandmother to encourage safe separation and develop speech and language skills. \" After two months of intensive integrated therapy, Maddie had a breakthrough. \" One Monday morning, the normally reserved and very anxious little girl greeted her therapist with a wide grin, declaring that she loves Mondays because she can spend time with her therapists and grandmother doing fun activities and afterward everyone is really happy.  Maddie can now communicate using phrases and short sentences with a range of vocabulary and expression, resulting in improved outcomes at home and at school. However, due to Maddie’s complex learning needs, her therapy has become more intensive from one session to the next. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that Maddie needed to transition from face-to-face sessions to online telehealth. Her therapists were concerned that the sudden change might disrupt her learning and stunt her progress. However, telehealth has provided Maddie with new opportunities and the potential to increase skill development within her own home. Through telehealth, our speech pathologist and psychologist can now have more frequent sessions with Maddie to support her development and continue the progress she has achieved within the last few months.  Mondays have become a day of learning, fun, and happiness, where Maddie and her grandmother engage in an online session together. Her grandmother reports they are really enjoying all the additional activities and resources as it keeps Maddie busy, interested, and entertained, while also promoting her language and overall learning. In a recent therapy session, Maddie said that every day should be like a Monday – full of smiles and laughter. It takes a lot of hard play to heal little hearts. Although Maddie continues to improve, she still struggles with anxiety and will need long-term support to help her overcome the years of severe abuse and neglect. She’s experienced a lot of trauma in her short life, but with continued support and positive reinforcement, Maddie will go on to express herself with confidence, engage in conversations, and no longer be filled with fear.",

   "case_text": "Ethan was removed from his parents due to severe domestic violence, exposure to alcohol and drug misuse and their untreated mental health issues. Due to the tumultuous nature of his home, he learnt not to ask for help when he was scared, hungry or needed to go to the bathroom. Instead, if he hurt himself or was upset he became very quiet and subdued and would play with his hands to soothe himself. He was unable to initiate affection and even more uncomfortable accepting it. Ethan learnt to internalise his emotions and fear. He wasn’t aggressive, he didn’t yell or swear or throw tantrums and as such, he could easily fly under the radar. It was hard to tell that on the inside, this innocent eight year old was living in constant fear and couldn’t identify one person in his life that could keep him safe. The only indicators were his developmental delays in his speech and motor skills which were a direct result of his neglect and missed opportunities of learning. When Ethan came to Act for Kids at eight years old he was not regularly attending school. We made it a priority to increase his attendance, and work alongside his teachers to ensure he has the best opportunities to succeed. He regularly sees our speech pathologist and occupational therapist who provide him with a safe space to act out what he has seen, heard and felt. He is learning that he is allowed to want affection and that there are adults in his life that he can trust, to keep him safe. We are supporting his foster carers to respond to his remaining insecurities and as such, he is building a secure attachment to them where he can finally feel safe.

   "case_text": "The police report would later document that the children had been living in an abandoned shed with their mother and father, who had both served time in prison for drug offences. There was virtually no food in the makeshift home and both children appeared to be very malnourished. Drug paraphernalia was discovered throughout the shed, within easy reach of the young children.  Traumatised and frustrated Four-year-old Ava and three-year-old Zach were placed into the care of their grandmother, who had no idea the family had been homeless. Within weeks, Grandma would phone Act for Kids, desperately seeking help for the traumatised siblings. Both children had retreated into a world of virtual silence. Neither would look their grandmother in the eye and they barely uttered a word, aside from outbursts of anger and frustration. But it was the way Zach treated his big sister that troubled Grandma the most.  On multiple occasions, she had seen the boy violently punch, kick and bite his sister. When grandma would try to comfort Ava, she would scream in terror. She couldn’t bear to be touched: even with kindness. Instead, she would retreat to a corner of the room and stay there, rocking back and forth, until she calmed herself. After being assessed by the Act for Kids integrated therapy team, Ava and Zach met with Amanda, one of our Speech Language Pathologists for their therapy session. Both children are making progress, but there’s a long way to go. While they are still somewhat withdrawn, they have learned new social skills, are now talking, and Zach is having fewer outbursts.  These days, the siblings are helping each other in sessions more and are better able to identify and share their feelings. To Amanda’s shock and delight, Zach said something to his big sister at a recent therapy session she never imagined she would hear: “I love you!” he declared. That’s an incredible emotional breakthrough for a little boy who didn’t utter a single word during his first three therapy sessions.  Almost a year later, Amanda and the team are still working with the family.  “The trauma runs deep for these children,” Amanda said.  “They had been left in a cot – day and night – and their parents, possibly due to their drug use, didn’t talk to them, hold them, play with them or show them love.”  Left all alone – then taken from ‘home’…with nothing but the clothes on their back.  When she first met Ava and Zach, Amanda was struck by how underweight they appeared. “They were, and still are, very small for their age,” she says, describing Ava as looking ‘like a little porcelain doll’.  Our integrated therapy team, comprised of speech and language pathologists, occupational therapists and psychologists, use their combined skills to look at different aspects of the development and functioning of each child and their family.  From speech and play therapy to psychological interventions and developing school readiness skills, Act for Kids continues to support this family as the children work their way through the damage caused by their traumatic early years.",

Although they had escaped immediate danger they still faced numerous barriers to achieving safety and well being.  At Act for Kids they were supported by a Family Support Practitioner, a Domestic and Family Violence Specialist, and an In-Home Support Worker. At our first meeting, Mum expressed a desire to return home to her family for Christmas. At Act for Kids, we worked with Mum and her kids as well as linking in with their extended family to create a Safety Plan that enabled the young family to spend Christmas with their loved ones. \" Our Intensive Family Support team focused on linking them in other local services that could further help them on their journey to overcoming the domestic violence they'd escaped. \"   Some of these services included support for subsidised housing, counselling for the mother and Mia, a parenting program for Mum, a physical fitness program for women who have experienced domestic violence and a school readiness program for Mia.  For a short while, Act for Kids helped Mum and the kids to get around to their various appointments, but with our support Mum quickly obtained her license and with it, her freedom. Now, over a year later, this little family is thriving. They are immersed in the community, with a small group of friends and attending community events. The children are attending day care and Mum has recently started studying at TAFE. Mum now has a license, a car and is debt free – something she could only have dreamed about! They have moved into a rental property and have turned it into a home. Although the effects of trauma still lingers in all three of their lives Act for Kids has observed an immense improvement in their emotional well being.  Before saying goodbye to Mum, Mia and Hayden, we supported them in creating a Safety Plan for them to follow in the event that the perpetrator finds them.

No one played with Thomas, no one spoke to him, and he was fed only once a day. He ate with his fingers, gulping down food so quickly that he often made himself sick. Eventually Thomas was removed from his parents and placed with a caring foster family. Thomas was referred to Act for Kids with scars on his little body telling a tragic story of physical abuse. Equally heartbreaking were his developmental delays, a result of severe neglect. While other kids his age would laugh, run and play together, Thomas only had the development and coordination of a two year old. \" If a child experiences abuse or neglect at a young age, often their brain may not develop properly. Without intervention impairments can be permanent. \" \" Through no fault of his own, Thomas had fallen behind. \" He could barely walk a few steps without falling over; he had mastered a few words but could not string a meaningful sentence together. He avoided eye contact, never smiled and his vacant stare revealed his torment.

He particularly enjoyed the large play room at our centre where he could play and move freely, developing his motor skills and coordination as he progressed through therapy.

   "case_text": "Between the ages of three to 15 years old SDE was seriously sexually abused by her father BWX. Many years later she approached police and disclosed what had happened to her as a child. A police investigation pursued and in 2014 SDE’s father was convicted of offences against her and sentenced to 17 years in prison. This was later increased to 19 years following an appeal by the prosecution.After the police investigation had concluded SDE approached BBK to investigate a claim against her father for compensation for what he had done to her. It is important from the outset to establish the extent of a Defendant’s assets when pursuing an individual because, unlike an organisation, they are extremely unlikely to have insurance to cover such a claim. Whilst many people have a claim against their abuser directly therefore, unfortunately, many are unlikely to proceed because of the limited amount of assets that an abuser may have.In this child abuse case, an investigation into BWX’s assets from the outset revealed that he owned a number of properties and was in the financial position to be able to pay compensation to SDE for what he had done to her, in addition to her legal costs.As in all cases, a letter was sent to BWX setting out in detail the allegations of SDE’s claim. Accompanying this was an early offer of settlement because SDE wished to conclude the case as soon as possible considering the distress that she had already suffered during the process of the criminal investigation and subsequent trial. BWX, however, ignored this which left no choice but to issue the claim at court immediately to protect SDE’s claim as she was strictly speaking out of time to bring it because she was over the age of 21 years old.Shortly after this, in 2014, BWX appealed his criminal conviction and was successful due to an error made by the Judge in the criminal trial rendering the criminal conviction unsafe. BWX was then released from prison. The Crown Prosecution took the case to a re-trial and as a result SDE was forced to undergo the entire process again and bravely took the decision to do so and give evidence on the stand for a second time. Following the re-trial BWX was convicted again and sentenced to 17 years in prison to take into account the two years he had previously spent in prison for his crimes.During this time, SDE’S case for compensation against her father was placed on hold pending the outcome of the re-trial but upon conclusion of the criminal case the civil claim was restored at court. BWX then produced a document known as a Defence in which again he protested his innocence.As part of a claim for compensation the parties are required to comply with court deadlines. BWX failed to do so and as a result a successful application was made for his Defence to be struck out entirely. This meant that SDE won her claim against him and what remained was to determine the value of it.In these types of claims we rely upon medical evidence from expert psychiatrists to comment upon the effects of abuse upon our clients. In SDE’s case, she was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and depression as a result of her father’s assaults upon her. It was argued that because of these mental health difficulties SDE’s career had suffered resulting in a loss of earnings.The claim proceeded and for a while it looked as though the claim was going to have to go to trial because of BWX’s lack of engagement with the claim. Shortly before trial, however, an offer was received from him and, following negotiation, the claim settled for a six figure sum. This was exactly twice the amount that SDE had advised that she would accept at the outset of the claim. This will enable SDE to obtain the treatment that she needs to treat her mental health difficulties caused directly by her father.In this case SDE was in receipt of benefits and so a personal injury trust was set up into which her compensation could be paid in order to protect her entitlement to benefits in the future. This was very important because, as a result of the abuse, she is unable to have the career and earnings that she would have done had her father never abused her.",

   "case_text": "In June 2012, Mr K was viciously attacked by his neighbour, a reputable Professor of Science, for “making too much noise”.The Professor kicked down Mr K’s door and ran into his living room with a large kitchen knife. He screamed obscenities at Mr K, made threats to kill him, and then lunged at him and began slashing at him with the knife. He repeatedly punched Mr K in the face. He then punched Mr K in the chest with such force that he hit the window, causing the window pane to break.Mr K eventually managed to run out of the house and call the police. The Professor was arrested and in September 2012 he was convicted for unlawful wounding and damage to property of a value unknown. He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment, which was suspended for 18 months.Mr K suffered physical and psychiatric injuries as a result of the assaults. He suffered lacerations and bruising to his head and leg. He also suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which led to significant psychological distress and impairment of his quality of life for a period of 13 to 14 months following the assaults. He underwent a course of hypnotherapy.Mr K contacted BBK in July 2013, to pursue a claim for compensation. The first step in this claim was to ascertain if the Professor had sufficient assets to make it worthwhile pursuing him and to this end, we obtained an asset report into his financial position. This revealed that the Professor did not have any sizeable assets but he did receive funding and grants for his research projects and he was a reputable figure in his field and therefore it would be worth pursuing him.Once the claim process started, the Professor failed to engage despite our numerous efforts to contact him. We therefore issued court proceedings against him. It was at this stage that he finally responded to the claim, but only to plead his innocence and to assert that he had no money and therefore we should abandon the case against him. We, of course, continued with the claim and just weeks before the trial, the Professor agreed to an out of court settlement.",

   "case_text": "Bolt Burdon Kemp recently settled a claim for £200,000 on behalf of our client, Maureen Wood, against Staffordshire Council for their negligence in failing to protect her from serious abuse at the hands of her mother, brother and stepfather.Trigger Warning – This article contains references to serious sexual abuse suffered in childhood. If this makes you uncomfortable or brings up negative emotions for you we would recommend that you do not read any further.Our client, Maureen Wood, approached us following the successful conviction of her mother, stepfather and brother for serious sexual abuse throughout her childhood which spanned years of repeated rapes and pregnancy.From a very young age Maureen and her siblings were placed in to the care of a local authority following the separation of her parents. When Maureen was aged in or around 7 years old her mother returned and took her children out of the care of the local authority. Maureen and her siblings were introduced to their new stepfather, John Wood.At around the age of 8 years of age Maureen’s older brother, Jock, started to touch her inappropriately. Maureen knew what Jock was doing was wrong but was unable to turn to anyone to tell them what was happening. Jock raped Maureen at the age of 9 years old and continued to rape her for some time.A year later, Maureen’s stepfather caught Jock raping Maureen. Relieved, Maureen hoped her ordeal was over. However, soon after John Wood started to abuse Maureen also. When her mother learned of the abuse she too commenced abusing Maureen.When Maureen was 13 she fell pregnant. Maureen’s mother told her to lie about the paternity of the child. Maureen gave birth to a baby boy, Christopher. Weeks after his birth Christopher passed way due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Whilst Maureen’s mother and brother stopped abusing her, her stepfather continued to do so until she was 16.Throughout the whole of Maureen’s childhood social services were heavily involved with both Maureen and her family. There were entries in the records that indicated that the local authority had grave suspicions about Jock and suspected that he may have been abusing one of his sisters. Despite this social services did not fully investigate their suspicions. Jock was asked whether he was abusing his sister and he said he was not. This was accepted and Maureen was not consulted by any social workers with suspicions.Due to the time that had passed between the abuse and Maureen instructing BBK many of the family’s social services records had either been inadvertently destroyed or lost by the local authority. It was on this basis that they sought to say that they were not liable for the abuse Maureen had suffered as there were not enough records to now fully investigate the claim.Whilst there were few records, given social services’ ongoing involvement with the family it was clear to Bolt Burdon Kemp that there was enough in the records to indicate that Maureen had been totally let down by social services. There were clear signs which should have been fully investigated but never were which led to her suffering horrendous abuse by her family.Whilst the council sought to defend the claim it was evident that they were aware that the signs of negligence were present. It was on this basis that both parties met and the council ultimately offered £200,000 to settle Maureen’s claim.Unsurprisingly, Maureen has suffered the effects of the abuse for her whole life and it is unlikely that the symptoms will ever abate. With the compensation awarded by the council Maureen can now access the therapy she requires on a private basis for as long as required.Whilst the compensation will never replace her childhood or bring back Christopher, Maureen has indicated that she wishes to use the compensation to give her children the sort of life she did not have.",

   "case_text": "Alexandra approached BBK for help in representing her in her claim for compensation against Derek Lampitt who seriously sexually abused her between the ages of 10 and 14 years old in both his and her home.At the age of 14, Alexandra was unable to deal with what was happening to her anymore and she disclosed to a family member what Lampitt had been doing to her. A report to the police then followed. Alexandra understandably found the prospect of having to tell a stranger what had happened to her extremely daunting and still does to this day. As a result however Lampitt was prosecuted and convicted of offences against her and another two victims and was sent to prison for eight years. He was also made to sign the sex offenders register for life.The police investigation and criminal trial however took place while Alexandra was studying for and taking her GCSE exams. As a result she found it extremely difficult to concentrate at school and her attendance and performance declined substantially. She left school at the age of 16 years old with few qualifications and poor grades in the exams that she was able to sit.In light of the poor exam results Alexandra was unable to pursue her chosen career and she experienced difficulty securing any employment.BBK therefore brought a claim against Lampitt directly for the abuse he inflicted upon Alexandra and the effect that it had on her life. Specialist medical experts were instructed and Alexandra was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse for which she was recommended a course of treatment.Lampitt however refused to co-operate and did not respond throughout the lifetime of the claim. To progress therefore judgment was entered against him as soon as it was possible to do so meaning that Alexandra won her claim and that it would fall to a Judge to assess the compensation she should be awarded. BBK obtained court orders for charges against Lampitt’s property in the meantime to ensure that he could not dispose of his assets to deprive Alexandra of her compensation.As Lampitt did not respond to the claim however it meant that Alexandra had to give evidence at the final hearing in front of the Judge. In preparation however, and on the basis that Lampitt could and was entitled to attend the hearing, BBK obtained special measures for Alexandra so that she could give her evidence from behind a screen.The Judge noted the serious effects that the abuse had had upon Alexandra and awarded her in excess of £180,000 to be paid by Lampitt as well as her legal costs. If Lampitt fails to pay this within the deadline ordered by the court BBK will take steps immediately to ensure that Alexandra receives her compensation by applying for an order to sell Lampitt’s property.With the compensation she has been awarded, it is hoped that Alexandra will now be able to access the therapy she requires in order to help her move forward with her life. She will also now be able to return to her studies and obtain the examination results that she needs to progress in the career that she always wanted.",

Between the ages of 11 and 16 Mrs G was regularly and seriously sexually abused by her grandfather. Like most victims, Mrs G was unable to tell anybody about the abuse at the time.Whilst at university, when studying to become a teacher, she was required to study a module about child abuse and was unable to cope. This prompted her to reveal to her friends that she had been abused. In time, she revealed the abuse to her family and reported her grandfather to the police. He was convicted and sentenced to eight years imprisonment.The abuse had a profound effect upon Mrs G. She felt unable to continue with her studies and abandoned her dream of becoming a teacher. She suffered from various psychiatric conditions which impacted upon her day to day living. Bolt Burdon Kemp’s Solicitor-Advocate, David McClenaghan, represented Mrs G throughout her case and appeared in the High Court before Mr Justice Leighton Williams QC.The Judge agreed with our submissions that Mrs G had been profoundly affected by the abuse and awarded her £82,500 for general damages, which is one of the highest ever awards for a victim of abuse. He also accepted our submissions that the abuse was the cause of Mrs G abandoning her ambition of becoming a teacher and awarded her £105,000 in respect of lost earnings. He additionally awarded her damages to pay for psychological treatment that she had been advised to undertake, plus interest. Mrs G’s total award of damages was in excess of £199,000.",

He was aged 12 to 15 years old at the time and was subjected on numerous occasions to serious sexual assaults by Sanger. Sanger also introduced our client to a man named Andrew Chambers who abused him on one occasion.RSA did not report Sanger or Chambers to police until 2009 when he saw a news item regarding a man who used to work with Chambers. Sanger was arrested in May 2010 and charged with numerous offences against our client. Upon being released on bail he committed suicide. Chambers had already been investigated for sexual abuse against children and had already been imprisoned with a maximum sentence.RSA’s educational performance and behaviour deteriorated during the abuse. His abuser plied him with alcohol from the age of 12 and to date he is still an alcoholic. The abuse therefore had a profound and lasting effect upon him. He suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and an enduring personality disorder. He has failed to hold down a job as a result of his alcoholism and will never work again due to his health issues.Notwithstanding the fact that Sanger was never criminally convicted of sexually assaulting RSA, a claim was successfully brought against Sanger’s estate and the church on the basis that it was vicariously liable for the acts of abuse committed by Sanger as its employee. We successfully secured RSA a settlement of £160,000 which will now provide him with the essential medical treatment he needs.",

One of the exacerbating factors of her grandfather’s offending is that he abused her whilst she was in hospital, and gave her alcohol to make her more compliant with his demands, causing her headaches and possibly unnecessary treatment when the headaches were assumed to be caused by her tumour.We sued the grandfather in prison. Although he initially admitted full responsibility, he then tried to partially withdraw that admission, only accepting that he had committed the specimen offences he had been convicted of, and claiming that many of the sexual acts were instigated by our client, which was particularly upsetting for her. There was however a keen desire on both sides to settle the claim and after negotiations a successful outcome was achieved.

The 29th Ipswich Scout Group, amongst other Scout groups, had been attending a Scout camping trip at Chalfont Heights Scout camp where our client was abused by Wright. Wright was the leader of the Chalfont Heights camp.Our client reported the incident to the police after he had seen Wright’s photograph in the newspaper which reported that he had been convicted of offences against other children. Our client recognised Wright immediately and reported him to the police. Earlier this year, following an investigation, Wright was criminally convicted of the assault on our client.BBK was then approached to bring a claim for compensation against the Scout Association on the basis that it employed Wright and it was in his position as a Scout leader that he was able to abuse our client. Thankfully the Scout Association acknowledged at an early stage that it was responsible for the abuse that our client suffered at the hands of Wright, saving him further distress. A successful negotiation as to the value of our client’s claim then followed with which our client was very pleased.",

   "case_text": "A little over a year ago Bolt Burdon Kemp was contacted by Simon who advised that at the age of 12 years old he was sexually abused by his assistant Scout master Michael O’Leary whilst he was a member of the 17th Fareham Scout Group. The abuse took place during scout meetings at a local church on a number of occasions.In 2013, some fifty years after the abuse occurred, Simon explained that he had reported the abuse by O’Leary to the police. O’Leary was then interviewed and admitted the abuse after which, for some reason, he was only given a police caution.The Scout Association were notified of the claim in which we argued that they were responsible for the actions of O’Leary as he had committed the abuse as a result of his position as assistant Scout master.Unusually in this case the Scout Association took no issue with the fact that, strictly speaking, Simon was long out of time to bring his claim because he was over the age of 21 years old – this would have been a complete defence to the claim had they raised it and been successful in the argument. Also unusually, the Scout Association accepted responsibility for the actions of O’Leary meaning that Simon had won his case at the very outset of the claim thereby alleviating him of any further distress.The next step was to assess the value of Simon’s claim by considering the nature of the abuse he had suffered and the effect that it had upon him and his life. One of BBK’s specialist experts was then instructed to prepare a report to comment upon exactly this.From the outset of Simon’s claim he made it clear that he wanted an apology from the Scout Association for what had happened to him whilst in their care. This was by far more important to him than any amount of compensation that he could hope to be awarded. With this in mind, it was made clear to the Scout Association that an apology would be expected as part of the settlement agreement.At present an apology is not a legal remedy and as such a Defendant cannot be forced to give one. Zahra Awaiz-Bilal, a Senior Solicitor in the abuse department at BBK, is currently campaigning for this to become a legal remedy and in this case, the Scout Association agreed to give a personal apology to Simon. It is hoped therefore that the more we campaign for this, the sooner it will become the norm in abuse cases because like Simon, every person affected by abuse deserves an apology.",

He preyed on vulnerable children from broken families, grooming them by giving them money, buying them gifts and taking them on days out. The grooming soon turned into sexual abuse of the most horrendous nature, with Hopkins raping most of his young victims on a daily basis.In September 2002, an allegation of male rape was made against Hopkins to Kent Police. This allegation was made by a former member of the 3rd Hawkinge Scout Group. Hopkins was arrested on 26th November 2002 and admitted the allegation. Thereafter, Kent Police initiated an enquiry and made a plea for other victims to come forward. It was during the course of this investigation that our clients reported their abuse to the police. The investigation revealed that Hopkins had abused as many as 38 children over four decades.During a search of Hopkins’ home, officers found diaries detailing his abuse of a large number of young men who at the time were all members of the Cubs, a substantial number of negatives, in excess of 170 different 35mm negative strips, and cine films of his activities. All of these were of an explicit nature showing Hopkins engaged in various sexual acts with his young victims, most between the ages of 8 and 13.Hopkins was charged with 20 offences of indecent assault, four offences of buggery and four offences of taking indecent photographs of a child. He pleaded guilty to all the offences. On 8 September 2003, in Maidstone Crown Court, Hopkins was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life and barred from working with children.Given the severity of the abuse, all five of our clients suffered a number of psychological difficulties, from personality disorders to post traumatic stress disorder; some had become addicted to gambling, some suffered from harmful use of alcohol and others from harmful use of cannabis and cocaine. They needed treatment. The abuse had affected their education and employment opportunities.We pursued a claim against the Scout Association on the basis that it was vicariously liable for the acts of Hopkins. Liability was admitted in all five cases at an early stage. Four of the cases settled out of court by way of negotiations and settlement meetings with one succeeding at trial.The compensation will allow these clients to receive the treatment they need and have the opportunities they were deprived of throughout their lives.",

He repeatedly emphasised to the members of the scout group how important trust was between friends and how important it was that they trusted him. He regularly took members of the Scout group on camping trips and they also attended sleepovers in the Scout hut.Costin appeared to be a fun and exciting figure to the eleven and twelve year old children in the Scout group. He allowed them to do things which their parents would not allow. He often supplied them with alcohol during sleepovers and camping trips and he would allow them to drive his car and ride his motorbike.In 1996, Costin was convicted of four indecent assaults on three sea scouts. He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and made to sign the Sex Offenders Register for ten years.BBK pursued a claim against the Scout Association, who admitted liability for the abuse by Costin early on.Thereafter, we proceeded to consider settlement of the claim by obtaining medical evidence from a Consultant Psychiatrist as to the effects of the abuse on Bob. The psychiatrist concluded that the abuse had had a profound effect on Bob in terms of his self-esteem and personality. He had experienced night terrors and nightmares and the abuse had also affected his intimate relationships and sexual life. It was likely that these difficulties would continue indefinitely.We advised Bob on a settlement proposal and, following negotiations, the claim settled. Bob was pleased not only with the outcome but also that the whole process concluded within 11 months.",

   "case_text": "A little over a year ago Harry approached BBK for help in bringing a claim against the Scout Association arising from serious abuse that he had suffered as a young boy at the hands of John Tapping, scout master of the 17th Fulham Pioneers. The abuse dated back to 1971 and occurred on a number of occasions over the period of a year on scout trips across the country.As is very usual, Harry did not understand what was happening to him at the time because he was so young and the abuse only came to light when another scout in the group disclosed his abuse to the police. The police then approached Harry and asked him to give a statement. After he had disclosed to the police what had happened to him, Tapping was then arrested and charged with a number of offences against members of the scout group including Harry. Tapping in fact pleaded guilty to the offences thereby avoiding the need for Harry to attend court and give evidence on the stand. Tapping was then sent to prison.As this case occurred such a long time ago it was important for two reasons to act very quickly when Harry instructed us. Firstly we needed to establish what evidence still existed all these years later to prove that the offences had occured. Secondly, technically Harry was extremely out of time to bring a claim for compensation because he was over the age of 21 years old. Whilst the court has discretion to extend the time limit in certain cases, we needed to show that a fair trial would still be possible so that the Scout Association could not argue that it was prejudiced from defending the claim all these years later. Evidence from the time was therefore key.Notably in this case, however, the police and court documentation were confirmed to have been destroyed due to the passing of time. In fact despite numerous searches down various different avenues, including a search of newspaper archives, no evidence of the abuse or conviction could be found thus making the claim very difficult to proceed.Despite this, the claim pressed on and an initial letter was sent to the Scout Association setting out the allegations that Harry was making. Despite initially requesting evidence that any abuse had ever taken place, the Scout Association very quickly made an offer to settle Harry’s claim. It was clear at that point that there must have been old records that the association still had from Tapping’s time as a scout master confirming that he had been convicted of abusing boys in the Scouts.BBK then instructed an expert psychiatrist to comment upon the effects of the abuse in all areas of Harry’s life. With the help of the report we were then able to effectively value the case at a higher level than was offered by the Scout Association. A counter offer was made in response and the case was able to settle just before Christmas much to Harry’s satisfaction.",

Although Bretherton had been convicted of offences against a number of members of the scout group in March 1988, unfortunately due to the passage of time it was impossible to obtain copies of the original court and police documentation and it was necessary to prove that Bretherton had committed offences against Gordon.

He initially contacted the Scout Association directly in 2009 and requested that they assist him in obtaining counselling in respect of the difficulties he was experiencing. The Scout Association declined to assist Mr P and in an effort to access the psychiatric treatment he required, he instructed Bolt Burdon Kemp to act on his behalf. We argued that the Scout Association were vicariously liable for the acts of their scout master in the face of their defence that they could not be liable for him as he was a volunteer and not an employee.The claim was further complicated by the fact that the scout master had committed suicide prior to standing trial. Because he hadn’t been convicted in the criminal courts, the Defendant denied that the abuse had taken place at all.

Thrower was the scout leader of the Shepperton Scout Group in the early 1990s. At the time of his criminal trial in the 1990s it was noted by the police that he used his standing in the community as a scout leader to abuse a plethora of boys in his care. Thrower admitted his guilt at the time and was sent to prison. Our client brought a claim for compensation having been abused by Thrower. The matter settled for £15,000 following negotiations with the Scout Association’s solicitors.Compensation has also been awarded to a client who was abused by Allan Pollitt. Pollitt was a gang show director in the Birkenhead area. Pollitt also used this position in order to gain the trust of the cubs, scouts and their families. Pollitt would often abuse children whilst on trips to see other groups’ gang shows and at their homes. Pollitt has been convicted of offences relating to cub scouts and children in a children’s home in which he worked. Our client was awarded £20,000 for the abuse Pollitt perpetrated upon him on several occasions.",

Our client gave a statement at the time, and Hounsome was convicted in November 1979 of sexually assaulting three boys including our client. Hounsome was sentenced to 9 months’ imprisonment.This case was tricky, because the criminal conviction of Hounsome was so long ago. As a result, many of the documents including the police and court records confirming what had happened no longer existed due to the passage of time. However, we continued to fight our client’s case, and managed to locate a newspaper article which had published details of the Scoutmaster’s conviction at the time. On this basis, we wrote to the Scout Association and put forward our client’s claim.The Scout Association quickly admitted responsibility for the claim, and we proceeded to negotiate with them to obtain over four times their initial offer to settle our client’s claim.This case was extremely important to the client, who continued over past 36 years to have flashbacks and nightmares about the assaults. He was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as still suffering from symptoms of anxiety and reaction to severe stress.

What is unique about James’ claim is that Horley did not physically touch James, but BBK were still able to obtain compensation for the psychiatric harm caused to James because of what he saw Horley do, as well as for the emotional abuse that Horley subjected him to.Horley, through his position of trust as a scout leader, was able to take the scout group away for weekends and on various camps. Horley gained the boys’ trust during these camps and would buy alcohol for the scouts and allow them to smoke tobacco.On these camps, Horley would make James and the other scouts shower naked, on the pretence that he was checking that they were clean. Throughout this ordeal, he would pass cruel comments on the boys’ bodies.On one occasion, Horley locked James in the scout hut and showed him pornographic material. Horley then made James watch as Horley performed a sexual act in front of him, which was obviously extremely distressing for a child.In 1997, James and another scout discussed what had happened and bravely decided to go to the police. On 9 June 1998, at Maidstone Crown Court, Horley was convicted of a number of sexual offences and was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.As a result of the abuse, James has suffered with mental health issues. This was confirmed by an expert psychiatrist who was instructed by BBK.Somewhat unusually in these cases, the Scout Association was persuaded, at an early stage, to settle James’ case and much to his satisfaction the case was settled for a five figure sum.",

Our client spent many years living with the trauma of her childhood and yet against the odds, went on to pursue a career in which she could provide the care and protection to others that she herself had been denied.  In 2018, she found the strength to approach BBK and divulge her experience but with no documentary evidence or witnesses, the case carried some risk. On the evidence of a jointly instructed expert psychiatrist, our client had developed Depressive Conduct Disorder in her teenage years which was caused by the abuse she had suffered in childhood.  BBK’s case was that this prevented our client from reaching her academic potential and that her earning capacity had been significantly impacted due to her low academic attainment.  The expert also opined that our client developed Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in adult life as a result of the abuse in a situation from which there was no escape. Initially, Lambeth offered our client £125,000 in full settlement of her application.  However, BBK considered that this did not duly compensate her for future psychiatric treatment.  On our advice, our client was pleased to accept Lambeth’s revised offer in the sum of £164,160 which was comprised of:This represents both the compensation due to our client but also the closure needed for her to address the difficulties arising from her experience.Our client said:“I can confirm that I am also very pleased with the outcome of my case, which has been a long and difficult journey for me.

She explained that as a child she was placed in a children’s home in Kent in around 1968 when she was around seven years old for a period of approximately a year and a half. The children’s home was run by Peter Hickman. From the moment she arrived, Hickman targeted Rachel and subjected her to horrendous emotional and physical abuse in the home. He would regularly taunt her and call her ‘ugly,’ ‘a liar’ and ‘a disgusting little girl.’ Understandably after time, Rachel began to believe what he said to her and lost all confidence in herself. On the first night in the children’s home Hickman stripped Rachel and scrubbed her naked body leaving her red raw. He placed a bar of soap in her mouth and told her it was to wash away ‘all of her lies’ before leaving her in that state for a number of hours. Petrified of Hickman, Rachel began to wet the bed. When Hickman discovered this he would rub her face in her urine. When she was six years old Hickman asked Rachel to put her hand flat on a wooden chest. He then nailed a nail into her little finger, the scar from which still remains to date. In 2006, as an adult, Rachel wanted to see her records from the children’s home. A meeting was arranged but she was informed that Hickman had died. As a result no police investigation could take place. Years later in 2012 it was discovered that Hickman was in fact very much alive. The police carried out an investigation and Hickman was charged with six counts of assault against Rachel. He was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment. BBK was instructed to bring a claim for compensation against the organisation that owned the home. This case was tricky because Rachel was strictly speaking long out of time to bring her claim. In order to assess the impact of the abuse upon Rachel, we instructed a specialist psychiatrist to prepare a report. The report revealed that Rachel suffers from a number of mental health conditions and requires treatment. After a letter was sent to the organisation setting out the basis of the claim, a response was received defending the claim. Despite this however, an early offer of settlement of four figures was put to Rachel but on our advice, this was rejected as being far too low. After some negotiation Rachel’s case settled for a five figure sum. Whilst this will in no way change the past or make up for what she has been through, it means that Rachel can now access treatment as and when she needs it. This was a very sad case but one that came to a successful conclusion for our client.",

   "case_text": "Our client suffered severe sexual abuse at the hands of his Deputy Housemaster Father Michael (John Michael Creagh) at Douai Abbey Monastic Boarding School between 1987 and 1988, while pursuing his dream of becoming a squash champion.  Despite being only 12 years old when the abuse took place, our client found the courage to report the abuse to the police and Father Creagh was convicted of 3 sexual offences, on his own confession, at Reading Crown Court on 6 August 1992.  Father Michael received a concurrent sentence totalling 27 months imprisonment. In 2018 our client felt able to bring a civil claim against the school and contacted Bolt Burdon Kemp in pursuit of closure.  As this case occurred such a long time ago, technically our client was out of time to bring a claim for compensation.  The law says he should have brought his claim before his 21st birthday.  However, the court does have discretion to waive this time limit, but will only be persuaded to do so in very exceptional circumstances.  BBK believed there were good grounds for the court to waive the time limit in this case. Our client relied on witness statements and medical evidence to establish that he had no mental health issues prior to the abuse he suffered as a child.  BBK subsequently instructed an expert psychiatrist to comment upon the effects the abuse had on our client’s life.  The evidence confirmed that our client suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder which was attributable to his abusive experiences at Douai School as a child.  Our client also developed significant anxiety symptoms, low self-esteem and suicidal thoughts. In light of the evidence, the Defendant made an offer in the sum of £45,000 which was subsequently increased to £50,000.  On our advice, the client was very happy to accept the sum of £50,000, which represented an excellent outcome to the case.  This will assist our client receiving the psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation to move forward in his adult life.Our client said: “I wanted to send a big Thank you for all your hard work and being so patient with everything, including myself!” “I have been lucky to have amazing people around me and you are also one of them.”",

Blackburn was the Business Studies teacher and a Head of Year at the school and he used his position of authority to sexually abuse our client, who was a young pupil at the time, over the course of a year in the late 1980’s. As an adult, our client tried numerous times over the years to report Blackburn to the police for what he had done but our client’s deteriorating mental health prevented him from doing so.  In 2017, our client finally felt strong enough to come forward and reported Blackburn to the police.  During their investigation, the police discovered that Blackburn had sexually abused another child and thanks to the bravery of them both, Blackburn finally stood trial for his crimes. On 13 November 2019, having denied all charges, Blackburn was convicted on all 10 counts of sexual abuse offences at Caernarfon Crown Court following a four day trial.  Despite the offences taking place over thirty years earlier, Blackburn was finally punished for his crimes and sentenced to six years imprisonment.  He has been ordered to remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life. Our client suffered greatly with mental health difficulties due to the abuse he experienced.  After he instructed BBK, we took immediate steps to fully assess our client’s needs and the extent of the impact upon him, with the help of an expert psychiatrist.  We made clear to Gwynedd Council that our client needed access to medical treatment immediately. Given our client’s extensive psychiatric medical history, the council’s insurers, unusually, agreed to enter into negotiations with us to resolve the claim in full at the earliest opportunity to ensure that our client could access therapy without delay. Within seven months of first meeting our client, we successfully negotiated a five figure sum of compensation for him which will prove life changing.  He will now have the security of being able to access therapy as and when he requires and he hopes that he and his family will be able to move on with their lives.",

   "case_text": "BBK have recently successfully acted for a client who was abused by Jeremy Malim, School Master and French teacher at private school Brambletye School in West Sussex. Malim was employed by the school between the years of 1975-2002.  In 2002 we understand that allegations of child abuse were made against Malim by a number of previous pupils at the school.  He was charged with sexual offences and the case went to trial in 2003 at Oxford Crown Court which unfortunately did not result in a successful conviction. In 2014 Malim was again subject to allegations of child abuse offences by another previous pupil at the school and along with the victims from the previous trial in 2003, further evidence was gathered by the police.  This culminated in a further trial against Malim in September 2017 which resulted in a hung jury.  A new trial date was set down for December 2017 as the CPS were determined to continue with the prosecution. In 2017 our client reported similar sexual offences to the police that he had suffered at the hands of Malim as his teacher at the school when he was a young boy.  The trial that had been re-arranged for December 2017 was, therefore, placed on hold whilst these further allegations were investigated and further victims came forward again.  Malim was then charged with a further nine offences of indecent assault against numerous victims, including our client and the trial went ahead in August 2018 at Lewes Crown Court. Thanks to the bravery of our client and others, on 30 August 2018, Malim was finally convicted for his crimes that spanned many years and sentenced to six year imprisonment as well as being ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. BBK brought a claim for our client against Brambletye School in relation to the abuse that he suffered at the hands of Malim.  As part of the claim our client was seen by one of our expert psychiatrists who provided us with a report setting out just how the abuse had impacted our client in various aspects of his life. One tricky aspect of this claim was that our client was technically out of time to bring a claim for compensation because he was over the age of 21 which is the legal deadline when sexual offences happen to you as a child.After entering into negotiation, however, we were able to secure our client a five figure sum of compensation which he can now use to access private therapy as and when he requires it in order to help begin to address some of the issues that Malim had caused him to suffer in his life.This case shows that it is through the determination of survivors of abuse that paedophiles are still being convicted for their crimes decades later and that justice can be served even after so many years.",

As a result of the abuse, our client’s education was disrupted.  She did not achieve the grades she was predicted and this had a detrimental impact on her future earnings.  The abuse also lead to a significant deterioration in her mental health, which continued to hinder her career and relationships with others.  We instructed an expert psychiatrist who diagnosed our client with Major Depressive Disorder and Alcohol Dependence Syndrome and found that the abuse our client suffered contributed to these diagnoses. In 2013, our client summoned the courage to report the abuse to the Police.  In 2018, Wesley was convicted of assaulting our client, along with three other women.  Unfortunately, the CPS were unable to prosecute Wesley for sexual intercourse with a minor because up until 2004, a statute of limitation of one year applied, meaning that he couldn’t be prosecuted for this crime beyond that window of time.  In the absence of a conviction, we were tasked with proving that Wesley had also raped our client. Our client was technically out of time to bring her civil claim.  She legally should have done so before her 21st birthday.  However we were able to convince a judge to apply their discretion and waive the statutory time limit and allow her claim to proceed out of time.In order for her claim to be successful, we needed to prove that the County Council should be held responsible for Wesley’s actions.  This was made more difficult by the fact much of the abuse took place in Wesley’s home, outside of school hours.  However, we argued that Wesley had used his role as our client’s teacher to groom her.After lengthy negotiations, we persuaded the Defendant to increase their settlement offer to £35,000, which our client was happy to accept.",

Steven Joyce was a housemaster at the school and sexually abused our client, as well as a number of other individuals, whilst he was a housemaster there.  Joyce was convicted of a number of offences against former pupils at Marland school in 2017, and following an appeal by the Attorney General in relation to his sentence of 7 years, this was doubled to approximately 14 years in 2017. Following Joyce’s conviction, our client felt able to report the abuse he suffered to the police however in light of the fact Joyce was already serving a lengthy custodial sentence, our client was informed it would not be in the public interest to bring a new prosecution against him.  Despite this, we were able to successfully negotiate a settlement on his behalf.  We relied on the fact Joyce had previously been convicted of abusing pupils, demonstrating Joyce’s propensity to commit child abuse offences and abuse pupils, including our client.  We also argued that because Joyce used his position as a housemaster to gain access to and abuse our client, Marland School ought to be held responsible for his actions.  Being able to successfully conclude our client’s case enabled him to finally achieve an element of justice and closure that he was not able to obtain via the criminal justice system.",

   "case_text": "BBK has recently settled cases for three clients that were sexually abused over varying lengths of time by Brian Veevers, a woodwork technician at St Wilfred’s Catholic High School in Litherland, Liverpool during the 1990’s.Veevers preyed on male pupils at the school and carefully selected a number of boys to join his woodwork club that took place during lunchtimes and after school. It was during meetings of the club that he took advantage of them in the worst possible way by sexually abusing them.The abuse came to a head when the boys disclosed to each other what had been happening to them as, unbeknownst to them, they were not alone. The boys then reported the abuse to their parents who then called the police. Veevers was arrested but denied the allegations. He was then charged with sexual offences against five male pupils at the school. Despite the number of victims, Veevers continued to deny the charges and the boys were forced to attend a trial in 1996 and give evidence against him. Veevers was found guilty and sentenced to prison.Three of the pupils, now men in their 30’s, approached BBK with a view to bringing a claim for the abuse that they suffered. A claim then proceeded against Sefton Council as this was the authority responsible for the school. As part of the claim we attempted to obtain copies of our clients’ police statements but as is sometimes the case, these had been destroyed due to the time that had passed. Instead we were able to obtain a copy of the court documents detailing the charges against Veevers and proving the conviction from so many years ago. The case was also heavily reported in the newspapers and we were able to obtain copies of numerous articles that were printed at the time.All three clients were seen by our specialist medical experts and detailed reports were produced commenting on how each client had been affected by the abuse which is what we use to help value our cases.The council, as is fairly usual, argued that our clients were completely out of time to bring their claim and if they were successful with this argument, it would be a complete defence to the claims. Despite this, the council proceeded to make offers to settle each of these three cases.With BBK’s advice the offers put forward were rejected as they did not adequately compensate our clients for what they had been through taking into account the abuse itself and the effects upon their mental health and their lives. With further negotiation we were able to increase the council’s offers of compensation for each client on a number of occasions until we were satisfied that our clients were awarded what they deserved.",

   "case_text": "In February 2015 Bolt Burdon Kemp were approached by Timothy who had been sexually abused by his French teacher, Keith Cavendish-Coulson, whilst he was a pupil at the prestigious Terra Nova boarding school in Cheshire. In around 1974 when he was approximately 12 years old Timothy was sexually abused by Cavendish-Coulson on at least two separate occasions. The abuse by Cavendish-Coulson included a sexual assault in a classroom after he had invited Timothy to participate in extra French lessons. Terra Nova School later became aware that Cavendish-Coulson had groomed and physically, sexually and emotionally abused a number of pupils at the school over an extended period of time. The school allowed Cavendish-Coulson to resign from his position and failed to report Cavendish-Coulson to police or take further action.In 2013 Timothy was contacted by Cheshire Police as part of investigations into allegations that Cavendish-Coulson had sexually abused a number of pupils at Terra Nova School. Timothy provided a statement to police and went on to be a prosecution witness at the trial of Cavendish-Coulson in November 2014 at which Cavendish-Coulson was convicted of 42 counts of indecent assault against 25 former pupils at Terra Nova School.In under 12 months, Bolt Burdon Kemp were able to bring a successful claim for Timothy against Terra Nova School in relation to the abuse which he was subjected to at the hands of Cavendish-Coulson. Whilst Timothy had gone on to have a successful career upon leaving school, the abuse which he experienced stayed with him throughout his life. Upon the successful resolution of the case, Timothy expressed pleasure that the result had helped to bring closure to this issue.",

The local education authority were aware of this but did not ensure that Birtles was brought to justice at the time, merely enforcing his retirement following which it is suspected he may have offended again. In or around 2013 one of Birtles’ victims came forward again to the police to re-report the abuse he suffered whilst attending Kensington Primary. With the courage of this individual a new investigation was started culminating in the sentencing of Birtles to 7 years. Two of the individuals he abused then approached Bolt Burdon Kemp in order to obtain compensation for the failings of Newham Council. It became immediately clear from documents obtained from the police and from the local education authority that the school was aware of Birtles’ paedophile tendencies but did not take the requisite steps to ensure that he was jailed. It is clear that children were abused that may have not been had Birtles been stopped when the school first suspected his offending. The school sought to defend both cases that we brought on the basis that the claims were out of time. The school also sought to diminish their negligence when defending the claims in court.\nHowever, it was clear that whilst the school was happy to advance defences in the terms above they were aware that the likelihood of success would have been very slim indeed. Soon after filing Defences in both cases the local education authority put forward offers to settle the claims. Following some negotiations both clients received compensation that would allow them to obtain the counselling they require.",

   "case_text": "In 2012 Lucy approached BBK for help in her claim against Domenico Quirino. She explained that when she was 14 years old she joined a karate club at her school. Quirino was the instructor some twenty years older than her. Lucy really enjoyed karate and was soon attending four times a week. When she was 15 years old Quirino offered Lucy private tuition free of charge and told her that he would make her a karate champion. Wanting to improve her skills Lucy gladly attended the extra sessions with him. Soon Quirino began to send Lucy text messages outside of karate. This was then followed by messages on instant messaging sites. To begin with Lucy felt flattered that Quirino was showing her so much attention. This soon changed however as the messages became more and more frequent. The content of the messages also changed, from discussing karate to asking Lucy about boys and her sexual history. He told her that he was attracted to her and that he liked her body. Lucy quickly began to feel trapped and harassed. Quirino’s comments made Lucy feel extremely uncomfortable but she did not know what to do about the situation because he was her instructor. When she was still 15 years old, during a karate lesson, Quirino pinned Lucy against a wall by her arms and told her that he would not release her until she kissed him. She was unable to escape as he was much stronger than her and so she had no choice but to do as he told her. After this incident Lucy did not attend lessons for a number of weeks before returning to karate hoping that Quirino would leave her alone. Sadly this was not the case despite Lucy refusing to attend any more private lessons with him. Quirino continued to harass Lucy with messages and if she did not reply he would approach her during the group karate lessons. He began to drive Lucy home from lessons and it was during these car journeys that the abuse began to escalate. Quirino would force himself on Lucy by kissing her and touching her body under her clothes. She felt powerless to stop him. After she turned 16 years old Quirino began to have sex with Lucy – something he would try to later use against her as she was over the age of legal consent. Quirino continued to abuse Lucy in this way until she turned 18 years old. A few years later Lucy realised that she was struggling to cope with what had happened to her and she sought advice from a counsellor. With the help of the counsellor Lucy began to address the devastating effect of what Quirino had done to her and bravely decided to report him to the police. Quirino was charged with a number of sexual offences against Lucy and despite arguing that it had been a consensual relationship he was convicted in 2012. In 2013 Quirino tried to appeal his conviction putting Lucy through even more distress but thankfully he was unsuccessful and the conviction remains. As a result of the abuse that she suffered Lucy developed post traumatic stress disorder and depression. Such was the effect upon her that Lucy took an overdose and was admitted to hospital for treatment. Whilst she has undergone a significant amount of counselling sadly Lucy is likely to suffer reoccurrences of depression for the rest of her life. Lucy’s education has also greatly suffered as a result of Quirino’s abuse and consequently this has affected her career. Lucy excelled in her GCSE’s at the age of 15 but as the abuse escalated she was unable to concentrate on her studies and left school during her A Level course. She was later to enrol at college but by this time she was a year behind her peers. To her credit Lucy went to university where she obtained a degree and then a Masters. At the time of reporting to the police Lucy had just begun her PhD. As a result of the stress of the investigation and the criminal trial that followed Lucy was forced to take extended periods of absence from her studies which delayed her even further. In total therefore Lucy was four years behind her peers. On Lucy’s instructions BBK brought a claim for compensation against Quirino for what he had done to her. Whilst Quirino initially responded to the claim upon being notified, he then proceeded to bury his head in the sand and ignore all correspondence. In order to progress the claim BBK therefore quickly issued proceedings at court against him. It then became clear that Quirino had sold his house and moved elsewhere in, what we presume, was an attempt to remain unknown and avoid the claim. With the help of a detective however BBK were able to track Quirino down and secured judgment against him at court in light of his lack of response. This meant that Lucy had won her claim and successful applications for interim payments of damages and Lucy’s legal costs were made. When Quirino then failed to pay the amounts that Lucy had been awarded, charging orders were quickly registered against his new property to protect those awards should he try to sell his property again to avoid payment. As a result of his continued failure to deal with the claim BBK were forced to take the case to trial to be heard before a High Court Judge at the Royal Courts of Justice last month in order to resolve the claim for Lucy. Sadly this meant that she would have to give evidence in court again. Surprisingly Quirino attended this final hearing but in anticipation of this a successful application had already been made to the court for Lucy to give her evidence from behind a screen to spare her further distress. The case was heard by His Honour Judge Wood QC who awarded an amount of compensation in excess of £170,000 to be paid by Quirino in addition to Lucy’s legal costs. Of this amount, £105,000 was specifically awarded for the delay to Lucy’s career. If, as it is suspected, Quirino fails to pay this award to Lucy within the deadline ordered by the court, BBK will immediately register charges against his property to the value of the final debt owed. An application to court will then follow for an order for the sale of his property to realise the compensation that Lucy has been awarded and so deserves.",

   "case_text": "In 2012 Naomi approached BBK for help following serious abuse that she suffered at the hands of her music teacher at a school in Cambridgeshire between 1991 and 1995. She had previously been turned away by a number of other law firms who told her they could not assist.Naomi explained that she had reported the abuse to the police in 1998 on her 23rd birthday. She told police how the teacher had first raped her when she was 15 years old on school premises and the abuse continued over a four year period, even after she had left the school. The police interviewed the teacher who admitted that he had indeed had a sexual relationship with Naomi but that it had begun after she was 18 years old. In his interview he stated that it was a consensual relationship that ended because he was in love with a 15 year old pupil of his at that same school. At the time of his arrest he was also found to be in email contact with another pupil from a school in Plaistow, London where he had moved on to after leaving the school in Cambridgeshire in 1995.Somehow the teacher was released without charge and is now believed to be living abroad. The police however confirmed that he would be banned from teaching for life and was placed on List 99, the equivalent today of the Sex Offenders Register. Of particular interest in this case however, the police also revealed to Naomi that the teacher had previously been employed at another school which was also under the authority of Cambridgeshire County Council, where he was charged with serious sexual offences against two pupils. Although he was found not guilty at trial he was then shortly after offered a position at Naomi’s school where he proceeded to teach without facing any disciplinary procedures or supervision. BBK managed to find documentary proof of this from records that still existed in the teacher’s personnel file, suggesting serious failings had taken place. It was these failings that allowed Naomi to be groomed and abused by the teacher.We quickly obtained Naomi’s medical records which showed that shortly after the abuse began she developed anorexia which was to haunt her for many years. Reporting to the police also proved to be the catalyst for a breakdown which then led to nearly twenty years of serious mental health issues including self harming and numerous suicide attempts.As part of the claim we obtained medical reports from an expert psychiatrist who diagnosed her with depression, chronic post traumatic stress disorder and a harmful use of alcohol. As a result of these issues Naomi has never been able to hold down a job for longer than a few months and the prognosis for the future was that this pattern would continue and that she would need psychiatric input for life.BBK therefore brought Naomi’s claim against Cambridgeshire County Council who denied liability throughout the lifetime of the claim despite the damning evidence we had found.\nWe obtained a successful settlement in the sum of £550,000 for Naomi. This will enable her to attempt to move on with her life knowing that she is now financially secure.By obtaining this settlement we secured one of the highest awards in an abuse case ever in the UK.",

It was only after they had grown up, and were in their late 20′s that they independently started to come to terms with what happened to them, and the effect that the abuse was still having on their lives. They had co-operated with the police in bringing their abuser to justice through the criminal courts, but when it came to a compensation claim they were technically ‘out of time’. We sued the abuser’s employers, who maintained throughout that the claims were time barred and took their case as a test case first to trial at the Mayors & City County Court in October 2005 where our clients lost, but were given permission to appeal. Their case was heard in the Court of Appeal in April 2006 – our clients lost but the judges were sympathetic and allowed a further appeal to the House of Lords, which gave judgment in January 2008. Both our clients won, the Law Lords accepting that the old law was wrong, and overturned a previous House of Lords decision (an extremely rare event). The case, X & Y v London Borough of Wandsworth was one of a group of cases (known as A v Hoare and other appeals) which has changed the law and effectively allows child abuse victims the same rights as other personal injury claimants to apply to the court to waive the time limits in cases where otherwise a fair trial would still be possible. Our clients won damages of £57,000 and £70,000 respectively, as well as payment of their legal costs from the London Borough which had opposed them all the way.",

The abuse took place between 1981 and 1983, when Mr A was a pupil. He was aged 13 to 15 years old at the time and was subjected on numerous occasions to serious sexual assaults at the hands of two teachers who also abused many other pupils at the school.Mr A did not tell the College about the abuse, or report it to the police at the time. In fact for over 20 years he kept silent about the abuse he had suffered. The claimant’s educational performance and behaviour deteriorated as the abuse intensified and when he was 15 years old he was told that he would have to leave the school or be expelled. The abuse had a profound and lasting effect upon the claimant. He suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and depression. He performed poorly in school exams and struggled to form a career.Notwithstanding the fact that neither teacher was ever criminally convicted of sexually assaulting Mr A, a claim was successfully brought against Trent College on the basis that they were vicariously liable for the acts of abuse committed by their two employees. We initially secured early interim payments for Mr A which allowed him to have much needed psychiatric treatment before ultimately securing a final settlement in the sum of £125,000.",

Our client Mr X was a pupil at Clifton College Preparatory School and Clifton College Upper School in the late 1980s. Whilst at the Preparatory School, our client’s teacher ‘groomed’ him by singling him out for special treatment and praise and would make our client sit on his knee during school lessons. When our client graduated to the Clifton College Upper School, the teacher would invite him to his house and from there, he repeatedly sexually abused our client over a period of four years. When our client left Clifton College to attend another school, the teacher maintained his contact with him and continued to abuse him. It was not until many years later that our client was able to confront his past abusive experiences and in 2007, he reported the abuse to the police which resulted in the teacher being convicted of numerous sexual offences. Our client then instructed Bolt Burdon Kemp to pursue a compensation claim on his behalf. We successfully pursued the claim by arguing that Clifton College was responsible for the abuse as it had been committed by one of their teachers. Clifton College tried to argue that they were not responsible for the abuse as most of it occurred after our client had left their school, but at a round table settlement meeting they agreed to pay £200,000.",

Mr B bravely disclosed the abuse to the police when he was about 12 years old and his abuser was convicted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. The abuse had been severely damaging; it had a very disruptive effect on Mr B’s childhood, it disrupted his personal development and adversely affected his education and employment. Over the years, the abuse gave rise to a variety of psychological problems and resulted in Mr B developing a recurrent depressive disorder. We brought a claim against Cornwall Council, the authority responsible for the school, on the basis that they employed the head teacher and were therefore vicariously liable for the acts of abuse committed by him in the course of his employment. Notwithstanding various arguments raised by the Council against Mr B’s claim, we successfully recovered £65,000, which for him signified a long overdue acknowledgement that what happened to him as a child was wrong.",

Bolt Burdon Kemp represented the man, a former pupil of St Benedict’s Independent School run by the monks of Ealing Abbey.The former pupil – who cannot be named for legal reasons – claimed that he was regularly sexually abused by the former headmaster of the junior school, Father David Pearce. The abuse took place over a twelve year period in the 1980’s and 1990’s and started when as a boy he was just 10 years old. His claims were validated at Isleworth Crown Court in July 2009 when Pearce was convicted of 5 counts of indecent assault against him, as well as offences against other boys who attended the school, and sentenced to 5 years’ imprisonment. Father Pearce was known to pupils at the fee-paying, all-boys school as “Gay Dave” and he had a reputation among the students for favouritism and inappropriate sexual behaviour. He was due to be released from prison in April 2012. Allegations of sexual abuse by pupils at St Benedict’s date as far back as the 1960′s and go right up to 2009, and have been levelled against monks, priests and teachers. As well as Father David Pearce, John Maestri, a lay teacher at the school was convicted of crimes against children in 2003 and 2005. Father Laurence Soper, the former Abbot of Ealing Abbey, recently refused to answer bail to be questioned about his own role, and was last known to be working at the headquarters of the Benedictine order in Rome although he now appears to be on the run from the police. An international warrant is now out for his arrest and if he is caught he too is likely to be charged with sexual offences against children. Further allegations against others are still being investigated. In October 2011, the Pope ordered an historic apostolic visitation to look into the sexual abuse scandal involving pupils at St Benedict’s. This is the first time such an investigation has been ordered by the Vatican in England.",

Our client was sexually assaulted by his school teacher who had taken him off the school premises to abuse him out of school hours. The Defendants argued that this was not closely connected to the teacher’s employment.

Her social services records showed that she had suffered serious neglect and abuse throughout her childhood. Derbyshire County Council was involved with AKS’s family due to serious concerns regarding her mother’s parenting skills of her elder siblings, leading them to be taken into care before she was born. When AKS was born, and despite numerous reports from professionals and police that AKS was regularly left alone as a baby, that her mother was allowing strange men into the house and she was a drug user, AKS remained in her care. On numerous occasions, she was placed in temporary care when her mother abandoned her. Aged four years old, AKS was sexually assaulted by one of her mother’s male visitors. Despite this, AKS remained in her mother’s care, leading to a further assault, after which AKS was finally removed from her mother’s care by the council and made a ward of court. She was placed with long term foster parents, during which, she thrived in all areas.When AKS was 10 years old Derby City Council took over her care. As a result of the abuse and neglect she had suffered for so many years, AKS’s behaviour began to deteriorate as she struggled to cope with what she had experienced. Her foster placement broke down irretrievably. Over the next few years AKS was placed in a number of children’s homes across Derby. It was there that she was seriously sexually abused by a number of men believed to be part of a paedophile gang who groomed her and subjected her to sexual exploitation. We obtained a report from an expert social worker who confirmed that both Derbyshire and Derby City failed in their duties to protect AKS. We argued that AKS should have been removed from her mother’s care at birth and placed with suitable carers. Due to constant failures, she suffered a catalogue of abuse and neglect throughout her entire childhood with devastating consequences. AKS has been diagnosed with a number of mental health problems including post traumatic stress disorder, requiring a substantial amount of treatment. AKS’s education suffered as did her health. She has been unable to work and is unlikely to in the future. We successfully negotiated a six figure sum of compensation for AKS from both local authorities. This will now allow her to access the therapy she needs to help her in the future.",

In February 2013, our client found the courage to report Dowsing to the police and on 16 May 2014 Dowsing was convicted of indecent assault against our client. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment. The abuse that Dowsing subjected our client to had a significant impact not only on his mental health as a child, but also as an adult. At the time of the abuse, our client suffered a great deal distress and upset. He spent much of his time worrying about people finding out about what Dowsing was doing to him, but he felt powerless to stop it. As an adult, the ongoing effects of the abuse resulted in him turning to alcohol and cocaine. He has difficulties trusting people and this has had a negative impact on his relationships. He continues to have bad dreams and intrusive feelings and memories. We brought a claim for compensation against Hillingdon London Borough Council on the grounds that they were vicariously liable for the sexual abuse our client suffered at the hands of Dowsing because they employed him as a teacher at the school and his actions were closely connected with the performance of his duties and arose in circumstances where they entrusted the safekeeping and care of our client to Dowsing. The Council were very much aware how strong our client’s case was against them and they were keen to settle the case quickly.

Our client showed exceptional courage by reporting the abuse to her parents as a child.  However she felt completely let down because they accepted King’s denials due to his statue in the community.  King continue to have unsupervised access to children and continued to harass our client. It now transpires King had abused a number of individuals from the 1970’s onwards as he moved from Parish to Parish. The police began an investigation in 2002 after many victims had come forward, however King committed suicide on 31st October 2002 following his release on police bail before a conviction could be obtained. Our client only learned King had died after researching her abuser on the internet in 2018, at this point she felt safe to report her abuse knowing he could no longer find her. Our client had no conviction against King and was significantly out of time to bring her claim within the limitation period (3 year after reaching the age of 18 or the abuse ceasing, whichever is the latter).  However, there were striking similarities between the evidence of our client and the evidence of the others abused by King.  It was clear that the Church of England had failed to protect children from King, time and time again. The Church of England accepted our client’s claim without the need to issue court proceeding and agreed to pay our client compensation.  The abuse our client had suffered had never been acknowledged until this point and the civil action was to obtain recognition of the abuse she had suffered.  The settlement also allowed her to go on to have the appropriate treatment she required.",

   "case_text": "In May 2013, Anglican priest Gordon Rideout was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment after he was found guilty of 36 separate sex offences against 16 children. Following the sentencing, the Bishop of Chichester, Dr Martin Warner, acknowledged the “immeasurable and destructive suffering” Rideout had caused. Shortly thereafter, we were instructed by five of Rideout’s victims who were all abused by him in the 1960s when they were residing at a Barnardo’s children’s home, Ifield Hall, near Crawley. Rideout was the curate at St Mary’s church in Southgate. Our clients and other children from Ifield Hall would attend service at St Mary’s church and Rideout would sometimes hold the service at the gardens at Ifield Hall. He would also visit the home regularly. This allowed him to prey on the vulnerable children, most of whom had already been the victims of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of their own families, prior to coming to Ifield Hall. In around 1972, Rideout was the subject of an investigation at Aldershot Army Barracks. Our clients were contacted by officers at Aldershot who took written statements from them about the abuse they had suffered at the hands of Rideout. However, no further action was taken at the time. In 2011, following allegations of abuse by another victim, our clients were contacted by the police and provided statements once again. On this occasion, the investigation was successful and lead to Rideout’s conviction. All of our clients received a letter of apology from the Bishop of Chichester in which he expressed “the sense of deep shame that the trial of Gordon Rideout had brought to the Church of England”. The Bishop went on to say:\n“Due to the Church’s institutional failure to recognise abuse and report it in such a way as to bring about an adequate response, you have been made to carry the burden of criminal abuse and its effects for many years. I wish to pay tribute to your strength and determination in bringing to justice a person who betrayed so inexcusably the trust placed in him”. We brought a claim against the Diocese of Chichester on the basis that Rideout was a priest and he used his position to breach the trust placed in him by our clients. The Diocese admitted the abuse early on and gradually settled the claims one by one, with an overall payout of £110,500.",

   "case_text": "Our client contacted BBK in May 2015 for assistance in bringing a claim against the Church of England for the abuse she had suffered at the hands Reverend Terence King, the Parish Priest of St Mary the Virgin Church in Woodkirk, Leeds, which occurred between approximately 1985 and 1989 when she was aged between 6 and 10 years old. Our client reported the abuse she had suffered to the police in 2002 and King was subsequently arrested. However King committed suicide on 31 October 2002 following his release on police bail. Although King committed suicide before he could be convicted of offences against our client, we were confident that she could make a successful claim, as BBK had already made a successful claim against the Church of England on behalf of another client who had been abused by King. In addition, BBK is currently acting for two other clients who were abused by King. The similarities between the cases are striking. In the circumstances there was no doubt in BBK’s mind that King had been a dangerous sexual predator. BBK therefore sent an initial ‘letter before claim’ to the Defendant and instructed a Consultant Psychiatrist to prepare a medical report in respect of how the abuse had affected her life. The psychiatrist confirmed that as a result of the abuse our client had suffered from some features of post traumatic stress disorder. She had experienced recurrent recollections of the abuse and there has been a degree of avoidance behaviour in respect of reminders of the abuse. She had anxious dreams/nightmares on an occasional basis over the years. She also lacked trust in authority figures and avoided contact with priests and attending church services wherever possible. BBK disclosed the medical report to the Defendant and at the same time made an offer in full and final settlement of the claim. The Defendant responded by saying that they had no offers to make. They said that whilst they admitted that they would be vicariously liable for those acts of abuse our client proved were committed by King in the course of his employment, they were not satisfied that our client had proved the events she had alleged had taken place. BBK responded by informing the Defendant that they would issue court proceedings against them. As the court papers were being prepared, the Defendant had a swift change of heart and made an offer to settle our client’s claim in the sum of £10,000. Following negotiations with the Defendant, they increased their offer to £12,500, a sum our client was delighted to accept.",

   "case_text": "This client suffered serious sexual abuse at the hands of a Catholic Priest called Philip Challis between 1992 and 1996 when he was between approximately 8 and 12 years of age. Many years after the abuse had ceased, our client found the strength and the courage to report the abuse to the police and on 30th August 2013, Challis was convicted of nine sexual offences against our client and received a total sentence of thirteen years imprisonment and six years extended sentence. Following the conviction, our client contacted BBK for help in bringing a claim against the Catholic Church for the abuse he had suffered. As this case occurred such a long time ago, technically our client was out of time to bring a claim for compensation. The law says he should have brought his claim before his 21st birthday. However, the court does have discretion to waive this time limit, but will only be persuaded to do so in very exceptional circumstances. BBK believed there were good grounds for the court to waive the time limit in this case because: It was therefore hard to see how the Catholic Church would be prejudiced in defending this claim going forward. It was BBK’s case that the Catholic Church was responsible for the sexual abuse and assaults perpetrated by Challis because Challis was in a relationship with the Church ‘akin to employment’ and because the abuse was “closely connected” with the performance of his duties as a priest. Unfortunately in this case, the Catholic Church defended the case at every opportunity. One particularly unpalatable argument they made, was that Challis had been in a relationship with our client’s mother, and that it was Challis’ relationship with our client’s mother that allowed him access to our client, as opposed to his position as a priest. This allegation was completely untrue, however understandably it caused our client and his mother much unnecessary distress. BBK instructed an expert psychiatrist to comment upon the effects the abuse had had on our client’s life. The medical evidence confirmed that as a result of the abuse, our client had developed a Conduct Disorder. His education had been significantly disrupted. His emotional development, his relationships with those in authority and members of the opposite sex had also been damaged. In addition, he had suffered a loss of faith in religion and low self esteem. Despite continuing to deny liability for the abuse, upon receipt of the medical evidence, the Catholic Church made an offer of £37,500. They later increased their offer to £45,000 and then to £50,000.On our advice, the client was very happy to accept the sum of £50,000, which represented an excellent outcome to the case.",

   "case_text": "In 2010 BBK were contacted by Adam, who was 55 years old at the time. He and his family were parishioners of the Parish of Christ the King Church and Community Centre, where Father Paul Francis Cullen was the Parish Priest. Adam became involved in various social and religious activities arranged by Father Cullen in the course of his duties and was an altar server at the church. Between 1964 and 1972, when Adam was aged between 8 and 15 years old, he was sexually abused and assaulted by Father Cullen. At the time Adam contacted BBK, Father Cullen had not been convicted of the offences against him and his whereabouts were unknown. In 1991, there had been allegations brought against Father Cullen by three males who alleged that he had abused them. The CPS were proceeding against Father Cullen for these charges but he absconded following a hearing at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court in 1991. The police strongly suspected that Father Cullen went to the USA but the authorities in the USA had advised that, as Father Cullen was believed to be infirm, they would not investigate it further as extradition would be highly unlikely. Although the difficulties in this case were clear from the outset, BBK decided to investigate further and pursue a claim against the church on the basis that the abuse took place in the course of Father Cullen’s employment and was closely connected to his role as a priest. The church denied liability at the outset.Throughout this period, Adam continued in his own efforts to locate Father Cullen so that he could be brought to justice and kept in contact with the police. In 2012, a European arrest warrant was approved and the police tried to locate Father Cullen in order that he may be extradited to the UK to face charges brought by Adam and two others. The police traced Father Cullen to Tenerife and sought his extradition. Father Cullen was arrested and subsequently prosecuted. Adam’s claim was then put on hold, pending the outcome of Father Cullen’s prosecution. On 24 February 2014 at Nottingham Crown Court, Father Cullen pleaded guilty to 15 counts of indecent assault, five of committing gross indecency with a child and one of attempted buggery. On 24 March 2014 he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Despite this, the church maintained its denial of liability.The abuse and its impact, including the long struggle to bring Father Cullen to justice, had consumed Adam’s life. BBK obtained a medical report from a Consultant Psychiatrist who concluded that Adam was suffering from depression with psychotic symptoms and complex post-traumatic stress disorder. His education and employment had been affected by the abuse. The church, once again, denied that Adam had suffered in any way as a result of the abuse. A trial was set to take place in December 2015 but at a joint settlement meeting in October 2015, the church agreed to settle Adam’s claim in the sum of £95,000. Adam was most pleased, not only with the outcome but with the fact that BBK took his case on at a time when no other firms were willing to assist him and had it not been for this, he would still be searching for justice.",

In October 2012, Sophie was arrested and taken to Bethnal Green Police station for offences she was later acquitted of. Whilst in custody, over the course of approximately 3 days, Sophie was subjected to numerous sexual assaults by the Designated Detention Officer. The actions of the Designated Detention Officer were not only criminal acts, they also constituted a significant abuse of power. Sophie reported the sexual assaults she had suffered to the police and on 2 July 2013, the Designated Detention Officer was convicted of ‘misconduct in a public office’ and was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment. As a result of the assaults, Sophie suffered mild to moderate post-traumatic symptoms, which include intrusive memories, bad dreams, anxiety symptoms and avoidance of things that reminded her of the assaults. BBK brought a claim against the Metropolitan Police on Sophie’s behalf on the grounds that the Metropolitan Police were vicariously liable for the actions of the Designated Detention Officer because they were his employers. Sophie’s claim settled for 8,360 and she was delighted with the result.",

   "case_text": "At the age of 15 years old Elizabeth’s mother passed away and she was taken into care by Kent County Council where she was placed in Chatham Family Support Centre, a residential unit. The day after joining the centre Elizabeth met residential social worker Tony Graham. Graham was on duty at the centre four to five nights a week and was 41 years old at the time. To begin with, Graham befriended Elizabeth at a time that she was most vulnerable following her mother’s death and used to talk to her in the evenings at the centre while giving her wine to drink. As this continued, Graham would ply our client with alcohol so that she would become intoxicated. The more Elizabeth became intoxicated the more she came to trust Graham and would tell him about her life, something he was later to use against her as he would taunt her that she had neither a home nor a family that loved her. Within the first three weeks of being at the home Tony began to rape Elizabeth in the staff bedroom at the centre when she was intoxicated. This became the pattern every night when Tony was on duty at the centre. He would tell her that if she told anyone what he was doing to her she would not be allowed to see her two younger brothers who were in care elsewhere. A few months after the abuse began Graham’s girlfriend visited the centre and accused him of having an affair with another woman. Elizabeth overheard their conversation and spoke to the manager of the centre about what was Graham was doing to her. The manager however took her into his office and told her that her lies could get Graham into trouble and that he could go to prison. The manager never spoke to Elizabeth about her allegations again and Graham continued to abuse her on a regular basis. A few months after this, a rumour began to circulate in the centre that Graham was having an affair with another 14 year old resident. Elizabeth was not questioned at the time about these rumours and soon noticed that her external social workers no longer came to visit her in the centre. In records written at the time, which BBK managed to locate, Elizabeth’s external social worker noted ‘…the staff seemed to want to keep all social workers out of the centre and prevent them from having close in depth discussions with the children….trying to cover up and hush up’. She also wrote that if perhaps Elizabeth had known of the allegations against Graham at the time, she could have spoken up earlier about the abuse that she was suffering at his hands. By Christmas that year the police became involved in an investigation against Graham regarding the rumours of his relationship with the other child resident. Elizabeth’s social worker arranged for her to be interviewed by the police at a certain time so that she could sit in on the interview with her. When she arrived, however, she found that the manager of the centre had changed the time of the appointment and that it had already taken place in her absence. The manager also sat in on the interview with Elizabeth. She wrote in her notes that it was a deliberate attempt by the centre to prevent the truth from coming out and that the interviewing police officer had felt that Elizabeth was hiding something. After approximately six months in the centre Elizabeth was taken into foster care. Despite no longer living at the centre she would still return a number of times a week where Graham would continue to abuse her. This continued for another two months until Elizabeth’s foster mother found diary entries under her bed in which she detailed the abuse that she was suffering at the hands of Graham. Upon being informed of the diary entries, Elizabeth’s social worker took the notes directly to the police to ensure that the staff at the centre did not find out. Elizabeth was interviewed by the police and Graham was charged with and convicted of a number of offences in relation to Elizabeth and the other younger resident at the centre. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment. In 2012 Elizabeth approached BBK for help in bringing a claim against Kent County Council for the abuse that she suffered at the hands of Graham as well as the cover up of the abuse by the staff at the centre. Proceedings were quickly issued at court against the council who whilst acknowledging it was responsible for the centre and accepted responsibility for Graham’s actions, raised the fact that Elizabeth was 22 years out of time to bring her claim. The council also argued that Elizabeth, at age 15, consented to the sexual relationship with Graham. As part of the claim BBK instructed an expert psychiatrist to prepare a report on how Elizabeth had been affected by the abuse. As a result of what Graham had done to her, Elizabeth was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder and depression as well as difficulties in relationships. These symptoms were compounded by the cover up of the abuse by the staff at the centre. A trial was set down for February 2016 but BBK managed to negotiate a large settlement for Elizabeth without the need for her to return to court to relive her ordeal. When Elizabeth instructed BBK she advised that the most important aim for her in bringing the claim was to be believed as she had been let down so badly by those who were supposed to care for her the most. To this end, Elizabeth was delighted with her settlement as she felt that she finally had justice.",

   "case_text": "John and Lucy, who are brother and sister, approached BBK for help in suing Leicestershire County Council for neglect and sexual abuse that they had suffered as children.From a young age social services were involved in their family in Leicestershire where they lived with their mother and her partner. Their home was noted by social workers to be extremely dirty, their clothes were too small for them and they smelt of urine. Both John and Lucy regularly suffered from head lice and were often sent home from school in real distress. Teachers also noticed that they were always very hungry at school and would often steal food from other children.Once home from school Lucy and John were locked in their bedrooms and put to bed at 5pm. They had no toys to play with, very little bedding and no light in their bedrooms. Both were forced to go to the toilet in their bedrooms. Social workers for the council were aware of this but took no action to protect them.Lucy and John were regularly beaten by their mother and her partner in the home and were often covered in bruises. When Lucy was four years old she disclosed to a school nurse that she had been touched by her mother’s partner. Further reports of physical and sexual abuse followed and social workers were made aware yet no steps were taken to remove the children.Despite repeated protests and concerns from neighbours, teachers, a housing officer and health professionals regarding Lucy and John’s safety they were not removed from the care of their mother and her partner by social services until 2002 when they were aged 7 years 10 months and 6 years 10 months old respectively.Although they were removed from the home and placed together with foster parents, Lucy and John were still however made to visit their mother and partner at a child-parent contact centre. It was during these meetings that they were told to keep quiet about the abuse that they had suffered. They would be given crisps, sweets and chocolate along with the promises of new toys if they kept quiet. Lucy and John advised social services of what was happening during these contact visits but they were still made to attend. Instead they were told by social workers to make a signal to them whenever this happened.Over time as Lucy and John settled down in their new home with loving foster parents they began to disclose the extent of the sexual abuse that they had suffered at the hands of their mother’s partner and his brother. This information was recorded by their foster mother in a series of diaries over the years. Both children revealed that they had been raped by these men in their home. They were told that it was ‘their little secret’ and give them biscuits and sweets to keep their silence.In December 2002 Lucy and John were interviewed by the police. Understandably traumatised, the children made no disclosures. What proceeded was a lengthy police investigation and it was not until 2011 that the children were able to fully disclose what had happened to them to the police. The investigation then took a few further years to complete because of the large number of social services records that had to be reviewed and the amount of witnesses that had to be interviewed. Whilst reviewing the social services records we understand that the police noted repeated concerns from various sources regarding Lucy and John in the years before they were removed from home by social services.In approximately 2010 their mother’s partner and his brother were charged with serious sexual abuse offences against both Lucy and John. Their mother was charged with cruelty and neglect. As the men pleaded not guilty Lucy and John were forced to give evidence at trial.In late 2011 all three were found guilty and given lengthy prison sentences. The men were also both banned from ever working with children, ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life and subject to an indeterminate sexual offences prevention order.The trial judge was extremely critical of social services and concluded in his summary that ‘these children were grossly neglected.’ He was also extremely critical of the way that social services had assisted the children in preparing for the trial. The council later admitted that social services owed the children a ‘huge apology’ and that social services ‘had a lot to answer for.’BBK therefore brought a claim against Leicestershire County Council who denied responsibility throughout the lifetime of the claim despite the damning evidence we had found and it repeatedly refused to disclose their full social services files. In early 2015 however the council put forward offers of settlement to both of these clients which were accepted. Hopefully this will go a long way towards giving them the closure that they deserve.",

Whilst they were at the camp they suffered shocking acts of sexual assaults and violence by two of the Corporals who were only a few years older than themselves. To make matters even worse the Corporals themselves disclosed to a higher ranking Sergeant what they had done to our clients and his response was to laugh. This made our clients feel that they were powerless to stop it and the attacks continued on a nightly basis.After the camp, our clients reported to the police and the Corporals were given warnings for their behaviour which our clients were angry and disappointed with. Shortly after BBK was instructed to pursue claims for compensation on their behalf.We successfully pursued the claims by arguing that the Ministry of Defence was responsible for the abuse of the two Corporals as it had been committed by them as representatives of the organisation. Unusually in these cases, the Ministry of Defence admitted liability at an early stage which was of some comfort to our clients.As part of the claims we argued that the assaults had affected their education and as a result they would require additional tuition to catch up in their studies. Both clients were also affected very badly psychologically and required extensive treatment as a result of what had happened to them.We were able to successfully obtain awards of compensation in the sums of £23,500 and £26,500 respectively for our clients which were then approved by the court because they were minors. This money will remain invested in the court until these clients turn 18 years old however, we were able to argue that the court should release some funds to them now in order to fund additional tuition and counselling sessions which was accepted.",

Laura explained that when she was ten years old she disclosed to a passing police officer that her father had been sexually abusing her for the past four years. BBK quickly obtained Laura’s social services files and following a review of the records it was abundantly clear that Laura had been let down in the worst possible way by those who were supposed to protect her. The records revealed that after her disclosure to the police Laura was, quite rightly, immediately removed from home and placed on the child protection register to protect her from any further abuse. She was placed in a children’s home. Laura’s father was arrested and charged with numerous horrendous offences against both her and her stepsister however he was found not guilty at trial of all the offences he had been charged with. After the trial Laura returned to the children’s home for a few days before social services took the decision to move Laura back home. In doing this, social services failed to protect her and within a few weeks of returning Laura began to be abused again by her father. What followed was a period of months during which Laura continued to report to social services that she was being abused but she was not listened to, and social services even removed her from the child protection register. Shortly after returning home Laura discovered that she was pregnant and underwent a termination. No action was taken by social services and, again, over the course of the next few months Laura continued to tell her social workers that she was being abused. When Laura was 16 she then discovered that she was six months pregnant and soon gave birth to her child. By this time social services were no longer involved with Laura and her family and had effectively turned a blind eye leaving her to support her young child alone. In 2012 the police became involved in the case again and, despite not being believed the first time, she found the courage to report her father again. Laura’s father was soon charged again with numerous sexual offences against both her and her stepsister and this time he was found guilty at trial and sentenced to 19 years imprisonment. DNA tests carried out by the police at the time confirmed that Laura’s child was in fact her own father’s child as a result of the abuse that she suffered. This is something that Laura struggles with on a daily basis as a constant reminder of what her father did to her. As part of the claim BBK obtained medical reports from expert psychiatrists who spoke with both Laura and her child. These reports revealed that as a result of the abuse that she had endured, Laura was suffering from depression, post traumatic stress disorder and an attachment disorder to her child. They desperately needed help with these issues. BBK therefore brought a claim against the council who admitted that there were failings in the case. We have now obtained a settlement in the sum of £160,000 for Laura. Whilst no amount of money will ever make up for what she has been through, she is now able to obtain the treatment that her and her child require in order to attempt to move on with their lives knowing that they are now financially secure.",

Our client was sexually abused by her Adult Instructor whilst she was a member of the Army Cadets. The abuse commenced when our client was 14 years old and progressed to rape.During the period of abuse, our client developed psychological problems, depressive symptoms and panic attacks as a result of which her social development was significantly damaged. Following the abuse, she suffered from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic dysthymia and a number of complex psychological problems which caused her distress and affected her life adversely. The abuse occurred at a vital time not only in our client’s personal but also in her educational development. She was distracted from her education by the abuse and also physically removed from school by her abuser on many occasions, which resulted in her performing poorly at school and not being able to continue with further education. Our client’s ambition from a young age was to join the Army and be an officer in the Royal Military Police.

   "case_text": "Bolt Burdon Kemp acted for four clients who were abused when they were members of the Army Cadets in Harborne, Birmingham when they were youngsters. The abuse was perpetrated by two of the Captains/ instructors of the cadet force and it became apparent when investigating the case that sexual abuse of the most severe kind was going on behind the closed doors of the army hut, the rifle range and at camp. Not only that but the abuse within the Cadets was openly acknowledged within a permissive atmosphere, and appeared to be accepted as the norm. The Ministry of Defence employed the instructors so they became legally responsible for their actions.In September 2007, one of the instructors Peter Cooper was convicted of buggery and indecent assault in relation to one of the claimants at Stafford Crown Court. He was a serving police officer with the West Midlands Constabulary at the time of his arrest. Within the compensation claim we were able to successfully argue that the limitation period of three years should be dis-applied, because a fair trial was still possible, even though three of the Claimants had not secured convictions, and one of the abusers had died.All the clients had been severely affected by their ordeals, from the time of the abuse to the present day, and the abuse had taken its toll – all had suffered psychiatric problems and most had problems with work, their home life and relationships. We were able to secure a full admission of liability from the Ministry of Defence, who agreed to settle the cases to avoid court in February 2011. The negotiations resulted in the biggest compensation pay-out for a child abuse case that Bolt Burdon Kemp has dealt with. Whilst no amount of money can ever fully compensate the claimants, the financial settlement is a great result for the individuals and their families, who will hopefully be able to achieve some closure on the abuse.The Ministry of Defence provided a written apology to our clients acknowledging the mistakes made and the deep regret that it feels for allowing the abuse to happen.",

We represented Jake Pierce (who waived his right to anonymity) in his claim against the London Borough of Doncaster. Jake was born in 1976 to a family which was already known to the local Social Services department.Because of grave concerns by social services, he was removed into foster care at an early age, and stayed in care for 15 months until, with a change of personnel at the council, he was allowed back home with his parents. He went on to be horribly abused until he was 14, when he ran away to escape his brutal home life. It was alleged that social services failed to properly monitor him having returned him home.The case was strongly contested and went to trial in the High Court in London. Mr Justice Eady accepted our case that Jake had been abused and that – knowing what they knew – no reasonable local authority would have placed him back with his parents. Jake was awarded £25,000 for the physical injuries caused by the abuse he suffered at home. Doncaster appealed and the Court of Appeal gave its judgment in December 2008 – the law lords accepted the trial judge’s ruling that Doncaster had indeed been negligent and had exposed our client to abuse and neglect when a child by his parents.",

With our help TRA reported the abuse that he suffered to the police. The police advised TRA that Dale was suffering from Alzheimer’s and as a result was unfit to plead to charges of abuse in relation to three other victims in a previous investigation and consequently, the police were unable to question Dale about TRA’s allegations or prosecute him. TRA instructed Bolt Burdon Kemp to bring a claim for compensation against the Ministry of Defence. They defended the claim on the basis that Dale had never been criminally convicted and that TRA was decades out of time to bring his claim and therefore it was statute barred. As a result of the abuse, we argued that TRA had suffered chronic post traumatic stress disorder and was in need of treatment. We argued that due to his mental health difficulties and the feeling that he would not be believed TRA was not able to bring his claim any sooner.

Sergeant Major Edward Dale was in charge of the Cadet group and used his position to groom and abuse the children in his care over many years. In 2015 NSE, along with a number of other victims, attempted to criminally prosecute Dale for what he had done to them. Shortly before the trial, Dale was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and for this reason a criminal trial was not able to take place. NSE and the other victims still wanted Dale to face the court for his crimes so with support from the Crown Prosecution Service a finding of facts took place, at which Dale was found to have committed all of the offences against NSE. As he struggled to deal with what had happened to him as a child, NSE soon turned to alcohol to block out the memories of the abuse and quickly became dependent upon it. NSE suffered from a very poor memory and, in order to investigate his case, we instructed an expert neuropsychologist to assess the damage caused by NSE’s alcohol consumption.We argued that the abuse had caused NSE to become dependent upon alcohol which in turn caused him brain damage which affected his memory. This also caused NSE other difficulties including the employment that he was able to obtain and maintain. Had it not been for the abuse that NSE suffered, he would have been able to cope with a more challenging and higher paid job and that he had suffered a loss of earnings. Despite the finding of facts hearing, the Ministry of Defence sought to defend the claim and refused to accept that the judgment of the court was proof that NSE had been abused and denied that NSE was entitled to inpatient treatment for his alcohol addiction. After numerous attempts to settle the claim, we were able to negotiate a five figure settlement which was more than double the original offer from the Ministry of Defence and with which NSE was delighted.",

He later moved to County Ground Leisure Centre also in Swindon where he continued to abuse ABC. ABC contacted police in 2009 at the age of 27 having been advised that Devine had recently been convicted in relation to sexual offences against other children. The police advised ABC that they had in fact been attempting to locate him for some time. Devine, already imprisoned, was then prosecuted in relation to offences against ABC and two other boys. At first Devine denied all charges and pleaded not guilty meaning that ABC would be forced to give evidence at trial. In June 2011 shortly before the trial was due to begin however Devine changed his plea to guilty and admitted the offences. He was sentenced to a further 8 years imprisonment. As Devine himself unfortunately had no assets with which to pay ABC any compensation, the claim was successfully brought against the Council on the basis that it was vicariously liable for the acts of abuse committed by Devine as its employee.",

   "case_text": "Bolt Burdon Kemp were contacted by Edward in 2015. As a child Edward attended Wards Bridge School in Wolverhampton where he was subjected to repeated sexual assaults and abuse by his woodwork teacher Colin Laskey. The abuse took place on school premises during the school day and at an afterschool club which Laskey ran in the school gym. The abuse occurred between 1973 and 1975 and included a great number of incidents where he forced Edward to engage in bondage and sadomasochistic sexual activity. Edward previously investigated the possibility of bringing a claim for compensation in the 2000s with a different firm of solicitors. They investigated but advised that they could not locate sufficient evidence to support his claim and therefore stopped acting. As soon as Edward spoke to BBK we felt his claim had merit and began investigating what evidence had survived from the original police investigation and court case in 1975. Through extensive archival research BBK uncovered crucial evidence not found by Edward’s previous solicitors, including the certificate of conviction from the original court case and proof that Laskey had been convicted of offences against Edward. This evidence proved decisive in this case. BBK wrote to Wolverhampton City Council with details of Edward’s case in March 2016 and argued that they should be responsible for Laskey’s actions on the basis that he was their employee and he had used his position as a teacher to gain access to and groom and abuse Edward at Wards Bridge School. In February 2017 the Council offered to compensate Edward for Laskey’s actions, having previously denied responsibility for Edward’s claim.The compensation paid by the Council reflects the lifelong distress and hurt experienced by Edward and includes an amount to reflect that the abuse affected his education and career. Edward said that the compensation received from the Council was more than he imagined he would ever receive, particularly after his previous unsuccessful claim. BBK were delighted to have achieved a positive result for a very deserving client. Our skill and experience at investigating non-recent sexual abuse means we have the ability to achieve results in the trickiest of cases, where others have failed.",

Duggan worked at Battersea Park Road and Falcon Grove children’s homes in the mid-1970s and was entrusted with the care of the children who lived within the homes. Our client was subjected to severe abuse at the hands of Duggan soon after his arrival at Battersea Park Road and also whilst he was a resident at Falcon Grove. The abuse took place on the premises of the homes as well as outside the homes. Duggan would bring our client away from the homes, seemingly with the knowledge of the heads of the homes. Disturbingly, it appeared from our client’s social services records that there were suspicions at the time surrounding Duggan and his unhealthy interest in our client emanating from our client’s family and other employees at the home. Despite these suspicions very little was done to limit the contact between Duggan and our client. Duggan ceased working for the council although it has never been clear whether he was sacked or whether he left of his own accord. In Summer 2016 our client approached BBK to bring a claim against the council for their failures to properly protect him from Duggan. Despite the council not formally accepting that they were to blame for Duggan’s actions they settled our client’s claim for a significant sum. They have also provided an apology to him for the harm he suffered and the impact of Duggan’s actions upon him.",

   "case_text": "In November 2016 we successfully assisted Daniel in bringing a claim for compensation against Leicestershire County Council in relation to sexual and emotional abuse he was subjected to by Peter Farrands who was Daniel’s primary school teacher at Folville Rise Junior School in Braunstone, Leicester. Daniel was taught by Farrands during his final year of primary school between 1980 and 1981. Over the course of the year, Farrands groomed Daniel and subjected to him repeated and frequent incidents of sexual abuse including incidents which took place in a classroom setting whilst Farrands was teaching other children. Daniel first reported the abuse he was subjected to by Farrands to Leicestershire Police in 2012 and whilst Farrands was arrested and questioned by police he disputed Daniel’s allegations and the police came close to dropping their investigation due to a lack of witnesses. Fortunately, in around 2014 a number of other individuals who were also abused by Farrands independently reported their abuse to police and Farrands was subsequently charged with offences against Daniel and two other individuals who had also attended Folville Rise Junior School. In May 2015, Farrands was found guilty and convicted of a number of offences against Daniel and another individual at Leicester Crown Court whereupon he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Farrands was also made to sign the sex offenders register. It was an unfortunate feature of this case that Leicestershire County Council had missed opportunities to identify Farrands as a paedophile and prevent him from abusing Daniel and other children. In the course of their investigations, Leicestershire Police obtained a statement from the headmaster of Folville Rise Junior School at the time of Farrands’ offences. The headmaster admitted that during the late 1970s he was made aware that Farrands had indecently assaulted a pupil during a barge trip with the Scouts in the late 1970s. The headmaster who was also County Commissioner for the Scouts required Farrands to leave his post as a scout master however he did not report the incident to police and allowed Farrands to continue to work as a teacher at Folville Rise Junior School. Farrands subsequently went on to abuse Daniel and other pupils after this incident took place. Throughout Daniel’s claim for compensation, lawyers for Leicestershire County Council raised numerous technical points in an attempt to frustrate Daniel’s claim. Leicestershire County Council argued that Daniel’s claim was technically out of time as he did not issue his claim at court prior to his 21st birthday. They also required Daniel to prove that the incidents of abuse by Farrands occurred in the course of Farrand’s employment with the school and that they should be held responsible for his actions despite the fact that incidents took place in a classroom setting and the headmaster was made aware that Farrands had previously abused other children. Thankfully these arguments were not successful and we were able to secure compensation for Daniel to reflect the distress, suffering and psychiatric injuries he experienced as a result of the abuse he was subjected to by Farrands. As a result of Daniel’s disclosure a number of other individuals have now come forward to report abuse they were subjected to by Farrands. In December 2016 Farrands pleaded guilty to seven charges of indecently assaulting another four children, three of whom had been pupils at Folville Rise Junior School. Farrands was sentenced to a further two years imprisonment in addition to the seven years he was sentenced to in 2015.",

Bundhun was employed by the Trust as a mental health nurse in 2004. Over the 10 years or so that followed, numerous allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour were made against Bundhun to the Trust by both patients and female members of staff. However the Trust failed to take any adequate steps in response to these allegations and as a result they failed to protect not only their staff but also their vulnerable patients. It was not until March 2014 that the Trust finally suspended Bundhun. He was then convicted in August 2015 of four counts of rape and nine counts of sexual assault against six women and was jailed for life. Had the Trust acted appropriately when the allegations about Bundhun were first raised in 2004, they would have been able to prevent Bundhun from sexually assaulting our client. What must be remembered is that Bundhun’s patients were incredibly vulnerable and it was his position as a mental health nurse at the hospital that allowed him to commit these terrible acts of abuse against them. We feel very strongly at BBK that the Trust has to be held to account for their terrible failings so that lessons can be learned for the future. It is well established that sexual abuse and assaults cause deep trauma for those affected, so we sought not only compensation from the Trust for the assault our client suffered, we also sought compensation to pay for the treatment she needed to help get her life back on track.",

Our client told the enquiry that he was sexually abused by Heath when he was 13 years old.  The abuse left him shocked and upset, with confusing feelings of self-blame.  Our client tried to forget about the abuse but memories were often triggered by news reports, which made him feel anxious.  Our client felt unable tell anyone about the abuse until December 2016, when Heath’s appalling crimes were brought to public attention by ex-CFC player Gary Johnson.  Johnson’s brave action gave our client, and many others, the confidence to speak out. Our client was keen to bring his claim to an end quickly, given the ongoing impact the abuse had on him.  We were therefore able to swiftly negotiate an agreement with CFC within 8 months, securing compensation in the sum of £13,000, without the need to start court proceedings.  The club will also be providing a written apology to our client.  This will help our client to achieve some form of closure and allow him to move forward.",

Our client was groomed and manipulated by Higgins from the age of 14 and Higgins indecently assaulted our client on a frequent basis.  When our client was brave enough to confront Higgins, Higgins made it clear to him that if he did not comply, he would not succeed in having a career as a professional footballer.  This lead to our client believing that Higgins alone held the key to his career success. Our client found the courage to report the abuse by Higgins to the police soon after it ended in 1990 and was one of the very first to do so.  In 1991, Higgins was charged with indecent assault against six boys, including our client.  However Higgins was only tried for offences against one of the six boys and was subsequently acquitted.  This meant the CPS then offered no evidence in respect of the other five boys. Due to the rule of Double Jeopardy, frustratingly for our client, he was not then included as a complainant in the 2019 criminal trial against Higgins.  Despite this, our client bravely gave a further statement to the police to assist the prosecution.  On 23rd May 2019 Higgins was tried and convicted in Bournemouth Crown Court of 46 counts of indecent assault against a total of 24 boys between 1971 and 1996.  Higgins was sentenced to a total of 24 years and 3 months imprisonment and Sex Offender Registration for life. Understandably our client felt cheated by the criminal justice system because Higgins has not been held to account for the abuse our client was subjected to. The fact that Higgins had not been convicted of offences against our client made his civil claim much more difficult.  However, we felt strongly that our client deserved justice and had no hesitation in representing him. The abuse perpetrated by Higgins had a profound impact on our client’s self-esteem.  Our client developed major depression, anxiety and a serious eating disorder.  The expert psychiatrist instructed by BBK established that the onset of our client’s significant mental health difficulties were caused by the abuse.  Following negotiations with SFC, we were able to secure a settlement of £4,500 for our client, meaning the abuse he suffered was finally acknowledged.",

Higgins used his position at SFC to groom and manipulate our client.  During the overnight stays at Higgins’s home, our client was frequently subject to indecent assaults, which escalated in severity as time progressed.  Our client thereafter lived in fear of his experience becoming common knowledge. Our client’s experience had a profoundly detrimental impact on his mental health.  He developed an eating disorder and battled with depression and anxiety throughout much of his adult life, having internalised his distress relating to the abuse. For some years, our client felt unable to disclose the abuse due to the power Higgins had over him.  However, in 2016 he felt ready to contact the NSPCC helpline.  Shortly after, he found the strength to report his experience to the police.  In 2019, Higgins was finally convicted of 46 counts of indecent assault against 24 boys. 2.5 years of Higgins’s sentence related to our client. He then reached out to BBK. Technically our client was out of time to bring his civil claim.  This should have been brought before his 21st birthday. However we were confident that given the circumstances, we would be able to convince a judge to waive the statutory time limit and allow his claim to proceed out of time.  In our view, SFC, as Higgins’ employer, was vicariously liable for the abuse.  We also considered they were negligent for the following reasons:We were able to establish that our client’s trauma stemmed from his childhood abuse with evidence from an expert psychiatrist.SFC initially made an offer in the sum of £7,500 to settle the claim.  As a result of negotiations, they increased their offer to £12,500 and upon our advice, our client was pleased to accept.",

After disclosing the abuse, our client endured bullying and was ostracised by fellow pupils and staff who all disbelieved her.  Her mother made many attempts to obtain justice for her at the time, but sadly she was ultimately unsuccessful. In early 2015, our client saw a newspaper article online, which confirmed Hollis had been convicted in 2011 of indecently assaulting another gymnast.  This empowered our client to report her own abuse to the police once more and to reach out to BBK.  The CPS authorised charging Hollis with one charge of indecent assault against our client but in 2017, before he could stand trial and be brought to justice, Hollis died. One of the initial challenges in bringing our client’s civil claim was identifying the correct Defendant and establishing who could be held legally responsible for Hollis’s crimes.  Extensive research showed that since the 1980’s the gymnastics club had been the subject of numerous restructures, however our investigations led us to pursue the British Amateur Gymnastics Association, which in 1997 had become British Gymnastics, the governing body for gymnastics in the UK. British Gymnastics subsequently admitted liability for the sexual assaults perpetrated against our client by Hollis.  The important journey to obtain compensation for our client culminated in a joint settlement meeting in March 2020.  The parties agreed to a remarkable sum of compensation for our client.  This was a fantastic outcome and our client was delighted.  Our client commented “Thanks entirely to your support and intervention I am able to move past the abuse and towards a more fulfilled life on my own terms and not a life of addiction in the dark”.",

   "case_text": "Our client initially instructed another firm of solicitors to represent him in his claim against Southampton Football Club Limited (“SFC”) for the sexual abuse he had suffered as a child at the hands of Bob Higgins.  However, he approached BBK in 2019 to ask that we take over conduct of his claim, which we did. Higgins subjected our client to sexual and emotional abuse between 1987 and 1988 when he was Youth Development Officer at SFC and our client was an associated schoolboy with the club. Our client aspired to become a professional footballer and he considered Higgins to be a ‘kingmaker.’  Higgins earned our client’s trust and preyed upon the separation of his parents to establish himself as a father figure.  Higgins proceeded to indecently assault our client on numerous occasions.  When our client fought back against the abuse, Higgins went to lengths to undermine our client’s standing within SFC and treated him unfavourably compared with his teammates. Our client disclosed the abuse to the police in 1990.  He was one of six individuals to do so.  Whilst there was a trial in relation to one of the boys, Higgins was acquitted and so the CPS offered no evidence in relation to the others.  Frustratingly this meant Higgins was not brought to justice.  Our client was again cheated of justice when he was unable to be included as a complainant in the criminal trial of Higgins in 2019, because of the Double Jeopardy rule.  However our client bravely provided a further statement to the police to support the prosecution.  Higgins was subsequently convicted of 46 offences of indecent assault against 24 complainants.  Although our client had exhausted all avenues within the criminal justice system, we were confident we could secure him the compensation he deserved. The case was deemed high risk because Higgins had never been convicted of sexually assaulting our client; he brought his claim many years outside the time limits for bringing such claims; and the defendant was steadfastly denying liability and refusing to compensate our client. That SFC refused to acknowledge their part in our client’s psychiatric injury only served to exacerbate his distress.  We were nevertheless determined to obtain justice for our client and we issued proceedings against the club on his behalf.  We negotiated a settlement of £4,000, which our client was pleased to accept, knowing that the abuse he had suffered had finally been acknowledged.",

   "case_text": "In July 2012, BBK was approached by Billy’s mother. Billy was 18 years old at the time and suffered from a severe autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). He had limited language skills and he could not communicate verbally. He needed constant care and supervision.Between March 2010 and June 2011, when Billy was aged between 17 and 18 years old, he was physically and emotionally assaulted by his carer, Andrew Burke. After Burke started to care for Billy, his mother noticed a change in his behaviour and moods. She became suspicious and installed CCTV in the house to see how Burke behaved towards Billy when she was not at home. The recorded footage showed Burke physically and verbally assaulting Billy on numerous occasions, which included hitting and jabbing him, shouting at him repeatedly, eating his food and telling him that he “eats like a pig”. Billy’s mother reported the assaults to the police and Burke was arrested. There was a three day trial at Manchester Crown Court in May 2012 but unfortunately Burke was found not guilty. Notwithstanding that Burke was not convicted, on the strength of the CCTV footage, BBK decided to pursue a claim against Burke’s employer – Respite (North West) Limited. Liability was admitted at the outset but the main hurdle in this claim was proving the impact of the assaults on Billy’s life, given his pre-existing difficulties. BBK instructed a clinical psychologist with extensive experience in dealing with young people with ASD and learning disability who had experienced trauma. There were a vast number of records and documents to be reviewed in this case, from both before and after the assaults took place, in order to assess how the assaults had affected Billy. Given Billy’s inability to communicate his thoughts and feelings, the documents in this case together with witness statements from Billy’s mother and other carers, were the main evidence BBK relied upon. The psychologist concluded that the assaults exacerbated Billy’s ASD and caused him great distress due to fear and pain. It was also likely that immediately after the assaults, Billy suffered from post traumatic stress disorder. BBK put forward a settlement proposal which included not only compensation for Billy but also a claim for the expenses incurred by his mother in purchasing and installing CCTV equipment around the home, on the basis that these would not have been necessary had Burke not given her cause for concern. This was accepted by Respite (North West) Limited and Billy’s claim settled in the sum of £45,000.",

Our client then brought a claim for compensation against them and was awarded over £200,000 in damages by Dame Justice Smith, hearing the case at Leeds High Court in November 2010.

The family had been given a housing caution and were at risk of eviction. Laura was dependent on alcohol and amphetamines, which affected her ability to parent the children properly and meet their needs. She’d made allegations of domestic violence against her previous and current partners. The family were resistant to working with agencies - and agencies felt that both fathers had very limited input or interest in parenting the children. Saeed’s attendance at school was at 0 per cent, the other children’s attendance was low and all displayed challenging behavioural issues - including Rashid having a tattoo at the age of 11. The children became subject to interim care orders, which means they could be removed from their family and placed in local authority care, due to lack of parenting and care. Activity with the family Intervention with the family included activity designed to make an immediate impact like help with practical tasks in the home such as cleaning and washing clothes. This helped the family develop motivation, skills and a routine. Signpost looked afresh at the role the fathers could play in their children’s lives and revisited previous assumptions that had been made about their parenting. They built up trust and strong relationships with the fathers, for example by ensuring visits from Signpost fitted around Gary’s working hours. They worked with the children’s schools to address and manage the impact that Laura’s emotional state had on the children and helped Laura to attend Leeds Addiction Unit for help with her alcohol and drug problems.

   "case_text": "This Serious Case Review (SCR) was commissioned by a Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) following a notification in June 2016 of the severe neglect of Twins, (aged 22 months) referred to as Child L and Child M for the purposes of this review. Their Mother is in her 30’s, single, unsupported and resides in a Local Authority (LA) one bedroom flat. 1.2 In 2000, there had been Child Protection (CP) concerns of Mother’s failure to safeguard her children. CSC received a referral from a Health Visitor (HV) expressing concerns for her only child that she had at that time (aged 15 months) due to poor hygiene and concerns with the parenting capacity of both parents. An Initial Assessment (IA) was completed and on-going support from Sure Start Services was recommended and implemented. 1.3 Further referrals to Children’s Social Care (CSC) were received, one in 2001, a period when her second child was born and two referrals in 2002, a period when her third child was born. The referrals were in reference to the poor home conditions and the children appearing unkempt and dirty. A Core Assessment was carried out and was closed in February 2002, on the basis that any further referrals would result in an Initial Child Protection Conference (ICPC). 1.4 In March 2004, HV’s made a further referral to CSC due to the same CP issues, in addition to developmental delay and failed health appointments. Furthermore, a male family member, who was on probation for a serious offence, was living within the household. 1.5 In April 2004, a Doctor (Associate Specialist in Community Child Health) completed a medical assessment on the two younger children. It was assessed that they both required a management plan in relation to their speech, as they were deemed to be significantly delayed in their development. As a result, all three children were appropriately placed on the Local Authority Child Protection Register (CPR) under the category of neglect and emotional abuse. 1.6 Mother and Father separated in June 2004. Father returned to reside with the Paternal Grandmother (PGM) in another area. 1.7 In June 2004, a Review Child Protection Conference recorded that the child protection plan was difficult to implement as Mother was not demonstrating a commitment for change. Sure Start withdrew their services due to her lack of willingness to engage and non-compliance with recommendations to adequately meet the basic needs of the children. 1.8 Core Group Meetings were held in October and November 2004 to discuss the fact that mother was not working with the CP Plan as it was felt that the children were failing to thrive. In December 2004, Mother agreed to a Section 20 Children Act 1989 4 voluntary accommodation and the children were placed into foster care by the Local Authority. 1.9 One day later, Mother approached the Local Authority stating that she had discussed private family care arrangements with the PGM in preference to foster care. 1.10 The Local Authority carried out relevant child protection checks on the PGM and extended family. The children subsequently left the foster placement and relocated to reside with the PGM at the request of Mother. A subsequent full medical examination was carried out on the children by a Consultant Paediatrician. There were no visible signs of abuse found. 1.11 In March 2005, a transfer CP Conference took place in the PGM Local Authority area, who decided not to place the children upon their CPR. Their names were subsequently removed from the Mothers Local Authority CPR who agreed they would support the Paternal Grandparents in their application for an Interim Residence Order. 1.12 The Mother’s three children then became subject to a Private Court Hearing in July 2005 when the Local Authority were requested to provide the court with a s.37 Children Act 1989 report, as Mother was requesting to have the children returned to her care. 1.13 The outcome of the s.37 report was that the children were deemed to be thriving in the care of their birth Father and PGM. A decision was made by the Local Authority not to apply for an order due to the fact the children’s immediate basic needs were being met by their Father and the PGM. It was the view of the assessing social worker (SW) that Mother had not made sufficient progress to demonstrate an improvement in her ability to care for the children. It was recommended that a more comprehensive feasibility assessment is undertaken on Mother in order to assess her long term commitment to change, in order to meet her children’s needs. 1.14 The future of the three children became subject of private proceedings. The outcome is that they remain to this day, in the care of the paternal family. Mother subsequently disclosed at the time of this review that she has not had any contact with her children for approximately six years and prior to that it was supervised contact only. 1.15 Mother again came to the attention of Health Services and CSC when in 2014 she became pregnant with her twins. 1.16 In 2014, the twins were born prematurely. Significant medical and health conditions at birth meant they required treatment at several Hospitals. 1.17 After an initial pre-discharge meeting in December 2014 and a final discharge meeting in January 2015, from Hospital 1, the twins were discharged into their mothers care 1.18 On discharge, the twins were made subject of a Child in Need (CIN) plan, initially for six months, but against that recommendation, at the first CIN meeting, after a three- month period only, the case was closed to CSC. The Health Visitor (HV1) became 5 the Lead Professional (LP) to support the Mother and twins with community services and provision. 1.19 A referral from the Local Authority Housing Department to CSC, after a home visit in May 2016, identified there were CP and welfare concerns for the twins. 1.20 There followed a one-month period of inaction from professionals. During which time the twins remained in environmental conditions described later by the Police as ‘disgusting’, until they were taken by the Allocated Social Worker (ASW) to Hospital 1 at the end of June 2016. 1.21 A Paediatrician at Hospital 1 carried out a medical examination and confirmed the twins were suffering from severe neglect. The Police attended the Hospital and took out a Police Protection Order (PPO) and the twins placed into emergency foster care. 1.22 The Mother was arrested for Cruelty and Neglect. At the completion of their investigation the Police decided No Further Action (NFA) would be taken against Mother. 1.23 The twin’s future prospects, after this safeguarding action, looks assured as they begin the adoption process. 1.24 The LSCB considered advice regarding publication of this SCR overview report, from the Independent Overview Author (IOA), an expert on similar publishing decisions, and the LSCB Legal Services representative, who was a SCR Panel (SCRP) member. The LSCB took the decision this SCR will be published anonymously, due to the unique features. All geographical references have been removed in order to protect the identity of the twins, their siblings and family members.",

They worked with the local social worker asking for pictures to prove her identity. After exchanging letters ISS Canada contacted Martha to confirm they were her sons.

After they divorced, Audrey was to live with her mother, although she regularly spent a lot of time with her re-partnered father, Aden. However, when he discovered his wife had taken Audrey to the UK where she would spend some days before leaving to live in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the father feared he’d never see his daughter in Australia again. It’s important to understand that, unlike the UK, UAE is not a party of the Hague Convention - a fact that makes child protection and legal actions to return the child more complicated. The father immediately contacted ISS Australia who prepared an urgent application under the Hague Convention to return Audrey from the UK to Australia. Fast-tracked through the Australian Central Authority, the application was quickly picked up by the Central Authority for England and Wales, who immediately appointed a lawyer to pass the application at the UK court. With the coordinated efforts of a vast network, we were able to process a comprehensive demand in only a few days. UK Police confiscated the mother’s passport to ensure she remained with Audrey in the UK, where the father’s application is now being processed though the English High Court.",

One year later, Hadiya found by accident a newspaper's article on her father with a photograph of him and the mention \"Wanted\". This event was a triggering factor for the young girl: she sought assistance to find her father. ISS became involved in Nigeria and, after having made investigations through its worldwide network, was able to locate Hadiya's father in Norway, where he was granted asylum. Contact between Hadiya and her father could then be re-established and their reunification has taken place after almost two years of separation.",

ISS was then requested by the relevant authorities in Adriano's country of origin to provide them with a post-adoption report every 6 months for a period of two years to ensure that the little boy was fine and developing well. From the first investigations made by ISS, it appeared that Adriano was a loving boy who was integrating well in his new family and environment. However, it came out that his adoptive parents had falsely told him that he was their biological child and had been temporarily placed in an orphanage after his birth until they came to search him to move to the United Kingdom. When Adriano was misbehaving, his adoptive parents were threatening him to bring him back to the orphanage as they had supposedly done before. In collaboration with local social services, ISS sensitised Adriano's adoptive parents to the needs of an adopted child. The couple progressively started to explain his personal history to their son, which contributed to fully respect Adriano's right to know his origins and grow up in a friendly and reassuring environment.",

Once in Paris, the children realised that France was just a stopover, and they soon left for an African country. After this clear case of child abduction, Swiss child protective services appointed ISS Switzerland to bring the siblings back. The father and children were quickly located by a local member of our network. This person went to the scene to assess the situation and to inform the parent of the unlawful nature of his act. At the same time, ISS Switzerland met with the mother, kept her informed about the situation and offered psychosocial support in cooperation with her lawyer. Once he realised he could go to jail, the father agreed to begin mediation. At the end of several long sessions, common ground was finally found and the parents signed an agreement for the voluntary return of the four brothers and sisters. Two months later, Mamadou, Abdoulaye, Fatou and Ndiaye were back in Switzerland, relieved to have left an unknown country and to be back in a familiar environment. While relations between the two parents remain tense, this intervention was still a success for ISS in that the children’s rights were restored thanks to successful coordination between two countries.",
